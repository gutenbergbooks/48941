<h2>AN AMERICAN "BEHIND THE
SCENES IN WARRING
GERMANY"</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Told by Edward Lyell Fox, Special Correspondent with
the Kaiser's Armies and in Berlin</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>This vivid and authentic narrative covering five months of
thrilling experience with the Kaiser's Armies in France, Belgium,
Austria, Russia and Germany, is the first hand impressions
of an American writer whose special credentials from the
German Government enabled him to go everywhere and see
everything through official courtesies not extended to other
observers in the field. Mr. Fox has interviewed the Kings of
Bavaria and Saxony, the Crown Prince, General von Hindenberg,
the Governor General of Belgium, and the President of
the Reichstag. He has witnessed the campaigning at close range
in the trenches at Arras and Ypres, has lived with the German
officers at headquarters, has surveyed the battlefield from an
aeroplane and a Zeppelin and has enjoyed the unique sensations
of scouting under the sea in a submarine, and as a final unprecedented
experience has covered with an official escort the
whole length of General von Hindenberg's battle line in Russia.
One chapter of his experiences is here recorded from his book:
"Behind the Scenes in Warring Germany," by courtesy of his
publishers, <i>Robert M. McBride and Company</i>, New York: Copyright
1915.</p></blockquote>

I&mdash;STORY OF A NIGHT ON THE BALTIC SEA</p>

<p>In the lingering twilight, the Baltic's choppy swells
turned dark and over the bow I saw a vague gray strip
of land&mdash;Germany! I was at the gateway of war.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>For two hours the railway ferry had plowed between
the mines that strew the way to Denmark with potential
death, and as slowly the houses of Warnemunde appeared
in shadow against the darkening day, some one
touched my arm.</p>

<p>"Safe now."</p>

<p>He was the courier. He had traveled with me from
New York to Copenhagen, a bland, reserved young man,
with a caution beyond his years. I had come to know he
was making the trip as a German courier, and he was an
American with no Teutonic blood in his veins! Knowing
the ropes, he had suggested that he see me through
to Berlin.</p>

<p>"It's good we came over the Baltic," he remarked, "instead
of making that long trip through Jutland. We save
eight hours."</p>

<p>"Yes," I agreed, "nothing like slipping in the back
door."</p>

<p>And being new to it then, and being very conscious of
certain letters I carried, and of the power implied in the
documents which I knew he carried, I wondered what
the frontier guard would do. During the two hours we
ferried from the Danish shore the passengers talked in
a troubled way of military search given every one at
Warnemunde and I smiled to myself in a reassuring way.
Yes, they would be searched, poor devils!... But the
courier and I? I wondered if the German Lieutenant
at Warnemunde would ask us to take coffee with him. I
even took out my watch. No, it could hardly be done,
for by the time the soldiers had finished searching all
these passengers the train would be leaving. Too bad!
Coffee and a chat with some other lieutenant, then.</p>

<p>"Yes," the courier was saying as the ferry docked and
we caught, under the glint of the sentries' rifles, a glimpse
of the <i>Landwehr</i> red and blue, "it will be so easy here&mdash;just
a formality, whereas if we had taken the other route<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
it no doubt would have been harder. You see," he explained,
"when a train crosses the Kiel canal a soldier is
posted in every compartment, the window shades are
pulled down and the passengers are warned not to look
out on penalty of instant death. Of course that is necessary
for military reasons. Naturally the whole inspection
at that frontier is more severe because of the Kiel canal."</p>

<p>By this time the big boat had been made fast to a long
railroad pier and as we crossed the gang plank we made
out in the bluish haze of an arc lamp, a line of soldiers
who seemed to be herding the passengers into what appeared
to be a long wooden shed newly built. Crowds
are the same the world over, so no one held back, all
pushing, luggage and passports in hand, into the frame
structure built, I realized, for purposes of military inspection.</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF THE GUARDS AT GATES TO
GERMANY</p>

<p>Sluggishly the mass moved forward. Presently I saw
it divide half-way down the room, to pause before two
openings at which six soldiers waited, like ticket takers
in a circus. I was near enough now to observe the lantern
light dimly shining upon two crude desk tops, slanting
down from the wall which gave entrance through a
doorway to a larger room beyond; and everywhere
gleamed the glint of gun barrels, the red and blue or
gray of military hats, while an increasing flow of German,
punctuated with "<i>Donnerwetter!</i>" and "<i>Das ist genug</i>,"
was heard above the shuffle of feet and the thumping
of trunks and bags on the counters in the room beyond.
I wondered what two men in civilian clothes were
doing among the soldiers; I saw them dart about, notebooks
in hand. Later I learned more of these men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
seemed to have it in their power to make the passengers
they challenged either comfortable or uncomfortable.</p>

<p>And then it was my turn. Having seen the passenger
in front throw both hands over his head, unconsciously
inviting the kind of search given a criminal, I decided
such submissiveness a blunder. As I expected, the soldier
was a perfectly sane human being who did not begin
punching a revolver against me&mdash;which certain printed
words I had read in New York implied was the usual
prelude to a German searching party&mdash;rather this soldier
most courteously asked to see my wallet. I gave it
to him. I would have given him anything. Our coöperation
was perfect. There was no need for me to bring
my exhaustive knowledge of the German language into
play. Talking fluently with my hands, now and then uttering
"<i>danke</i>," I tried to assist his search, meanwhile
hopelessly looking about for the courier. I was depending
not only upon his fluent German but also upon his
superior knowledge of the situation to help me to pass
serenely through this ordeal. Alas, the crowd hid him.</p>

<p>Suddenly my soldier grunted something. Until now
we had been getting along splendidly and I could not
conceal my surprise when he took from my wallet a
handful of letters and stared at them in bewilderment.
The more he stared the more his regard for me seemed
to vanish. Although he could not understand English
he could recognize a proper name, for the letters bore
the addresses of decidedly influential men in Germany.
They challenged his suspicion. Thoroughly puzzled he
opened the letters and tried to read them. When he compared
my passport with a letter I saw his face light up.
I realized that he had recognized my name in the contents.
Whereupon, greatly relieved, assured now that
everything was all right, I held out my hand for both
letters and wallet. Not yet. A rumble of words and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
soldier called one of those busy civilians with the notebooks.</p>

<p>This person spoke a little English. The letters interested
him. Where had I found them?... My spine
began to feel cold. I replied that they had been given me
in New York and remembering that I had the courier
to rely on, I suggested that they have a word with him.
It was then that I heard an excited deluge of words and,
glancing over my shoulder, I observed that the courier
was thoroughly flanked and surrounded by five <i>Landwehr</i>
who apparently were much in earnest about something.
Concluding that some cog had slipped I racked
my wits to make the best of what was rapidly becoming
a difficult situation.</p>

<p>The soldier having turned me over to the civilian I
noticed several suspicious glances in my direction, and
blessed the luck that had impelled me to go to the American
Legation and the German Consulate in Copenhagen
for visés. That the civilian who was taking such an interest
in me belonged to the secret service, I was certain.
I appealed to his sense of discretion.</p>

<p>"Your passport seems all right," he thoughtfully observed,
and opened a little book. "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>I told him to Hamburg but could not tell him where
I would stay, for the excellent reason that not the name
of a single Hamburg hotel was known to me.</p>

<p>"Only for a few days, though," I said, adding hopefully;
"after that I go to Berlin to Hotel Adlon."</p>

<p>As fast as his pencil could move he wrote the address
in his book.</p>

<p>"These letters," he said reluctantly, tapping them on
his hand, "I must take now. If everything is all right,
they will be sent to you in Berlin."</p>

<p>"But it is important that I have them," I protested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
"they are my introductions. You cannot tell me how
long I may have to wait for them? You can see from
them that I am a responsible person known to your people."</p>

<p>"I know," he replied, "but they are written in English,
and to bring letters written in English into Germany is
forbidden. I am sorry."</p>

<p>He was thus politely relieving me of all my credentials
when I happened to think that in my inner waistcoat
pocket lay a letter I had yet to show them&mdash;a communication
so important to me that I had kept it separate
from the others. Moreover I remembered it was sealed
and that properly used it might save the day. It was
worth a trial.</p>

<p>Realizing that the thing had to be staged I impressively
drew the police spy aside and employing the familiar
"stage business" of side glances and exaggerated caution
I slowly took the note&mdash;it was a mere letter of introduction
to the Foreign Office&mdash;from my waistcoat. If the
soldier's eyes had opened wide at the other addresses,
the police agent's now fairly bulged. Handing him the
envelope I pointed to what was typed in the upper left-hand
corner&mdash;<i>Kaiserliche Deutsche Botschaft, Washington,
D. C.</i>&mdash;and simply said "<i>Verstehen sie?</i>"</p>

<p>He <i>verstehened</i>. Being an underling he understood
so well that after a few moments he returned all the letters
he had appropriated and instantly changing his manner,
he facilitated the rest of the inspection. After my
baggage was examined by more soldiers (and those soldiers
did their duty, even going through the pockets of
clothes in my trunks) I was told I might go.</p>

<p>"<i>Gute reise</i>," the police agent called&mdash;"Good journey."</p>

<p>Although treated with all courtesy I was afraid somebody
might change his mind, so hurrying out of the last
room of the long wooden shed I proceeded down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
platform to the train at a pace that must have shown
signs of breaking into a run. There in my compartment
the thoughts that came to me were in this order:</p>

<p>There must be reason for such a rigid inspection; no
doubt spies must have been caught recently trying to
enter Germany at Warnemunde.</p>

<p>If I hadn't lost the courier in the crowd there would
have been plain sailing.</p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF THE MYSTERIOUS PAPERS</p>

<p>The minutes passed. It was nearly time for the train
to start. Where was the courier? Presently, rather pale,
nervous in speech, but as reserved and cool as ever he
limply entered the compartment and threw himself on the
cushions.</p>

<p>"They took everything," he announced. "All they left
me was a pair of pajamas."</p>

<p>"What! You mean they have your papers?"</p>

<p>"All of them," he smiled. "Likewise a trunk full of
letters and a valise. Oh, well, they'll send them on. They
took my address. Gad, they stripped me through!"</p>

<p>I began laughing. The courier could see no mirth in
the situation.</p>

<p>"You," I gasped, "you, who by all rights should have
paraded through, from you they take everything while
they let me pass."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," he exclaimed, "that they didn't
take your letters?"</p>

<p>"Not one," I grinned.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be damned!" he said.</p>

<p>Locked in the compartment we nervously watched the
door, half expecting that the police spy would come back
for us. We could not have been delayed more than a
few minutes, but it seemed hours, before, with German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
regard for comfort, the train glided out of the shed. It
must have been trying on my companion's good humor,
but the absurdity of stripping a courier of everything he
carried, was irresistible. Perhaps it was our continued
laughter that brought the knock on the door.</p>

<p>Pushing aside the curtains we saw outside&mdash;for it was
one of the new German wagons with a passageway running
the entire length of one side of the car&mdash;a tall, broad-shouldered,
lean man with features and expression both
typical and unmistakable.</p>

<p>"An Englishman!"</p>

<p>We saw him smile and shake his head. I hesitatingly
let fall the curtain and looked at the courier.</p>

<p>"Let him in," he said. "He's got the brand of an English
university boy all over him. We'll have a chat with
him. You don't mind, do you?"</p>

<p>"Mind!" In my eagerness I banged back the compartment
doors with a crash that brought down the conductor.
I saw my companion hastily corrupt that official
whose murmured "<i>Bitte schon</i>" implied an un-Teutonic
disregard for the fact that he had done something <i>verboten</i>
by admitting a second-class passenger into a first-class
coupé; and the stranger entered.</p>

<p>We were gazing upon a strikingly handsome, fair-haired
man not yet thirty. His eyes twinkled when he
said that he supposed we were Americans. His manner
and intonation made me stare at him.</p>

<p>"And you?" we finally asked.</p>

<p>"I'm going first to Berlin, then to Petrograd," he said,
perhaps avoiding our question. "Business trip."</p>

<p>We chatted on, the obvious thought obsessing me. Of
course the man was an English spy. But how absurd!
If his face did not give him away to any one who knew&mdash;and
my word for it, those police spies do know!&mdash;he
would be betrayed by his mannerisms. His accent would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
instantly cry out the English in him. Of what could
Downing Street be thinking? It was sending this man
to certain death. One began to feel sorry for him.</p>

<p>Feeling the intimacy brought by the common experience
at Warnemunde, I presently said:</p>

<p>"You certainly have your nerve with you, traveling
in Germany with <i>your</i> accent."</p>

<p>"Why?" he laughed. "A neutral is safe."</p>

<p>Expecting he would follow this up by saying that he
was an American I looked inquiring and when he sought
to turn the subject I asked:</p>

<p>"Neutral? What country?"</p>

<p>"Denmark," he smiled.</p>

<p>"But your accent?" I persisted.</p>

<p>"I do talk a bit English, do I not? I had quite a
go at it, though; lived in London a few years, you
know."</p>

<p>Nerve? I marveled at it. Stark foolhardy courage,
or did a secret commission from Downing Street make
this the merest commonplace of duty? Charming company,
he hurried along the time with well-told anecdotes
of the Russian capital and Paris, in both of which places
he said he had been since the war began. As we drew
near Lübeck, where a thirty-five minute stop was allowed
for dinner in the station, and the stranger showed no
signs of going back to his own compartment, I could see
that the courier was becoming annoyed. Relapsing into
silence he only broke it to reply to the "Dane" in monosyllables;
finally, to my surprise, the courier became
downright rude. As the stranger, from the start, had
been extremely courteous, this rudeness surprised me,
more so, as it seemed deliberate. Bludgeoned by obvious
hints the stranger excused himself, and as soon as
he was gone my companion leaned towards me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were surprised at my rudeness," he said, and
then in an undertone; "it was deliberate."</p>

<p>"I saw that. But why?"</p>

<p>"Because," he explained, "seeing we are Americans
that fellow wanted to travel with us all the way through.
He must have known that American company is the best
to be seen in over here these days. He might have made
trouble for us."</p>

<p>"Then you think he's English?"</p>

<p>"Think! Why, they must have let him through at
Warnemunde for a reason. He has a Danish passport
right enough. I saw it in the inspection room. But I'll
bet you anything there's a police spy in this train, undoubtedly
in the same compartment with him."</p>

<p>One felt uncomfortable. One thought that those police
spies must dislike one even more now.</p>

<p>"That means we may be suspected as being confederates,"
I gloomily suggested.</p>

<p>Whether he was getting back for my having guyed
him about losing his papers I do not know, but the courier
said we probably were suspected. Whereupon the book
I tried to read became a senseless jumble of words and
our compartment door became vastly more interesting.
When would it open to admit the police spy?... Confound
the luck! Everything breaking wrong.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF A RIDE FROM LÜBECK TO
HAMBURG</p>

<p>But at Lübeck nothing happened&mdash;nothing to us. A
train load of wounded had just come in and our hearts
jumped at the sight of the men in the gray-green coats
of the firing line, slowly climbing the long iron steps from
the train platforms. Hurrying, we saw them go clumping
down a long, airy waiting room and as they approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the street their hobbling steps suddenly quickened
to the sharper staccato of the canes upon which
they leaned. Hurrying too, we saw there a vague mass
of pallid faces in a dense crowd; some one waved a flag;&mdash;it
stuck up conspicuously above that throng;&mdash;some one
darted forth;&mdash;"<i>Vater!</i>"&mdash;"<i>Liebes Mütterchen!</i>"</p>

<p>Past the burly <i>Landsturm</i>, who was trying his utmost
to frown his jolly face into threatening lines that would
keep back the crowd, a woman was scurrying. One of
the big gray-green wounded men caught her in his arm&mdash;the
other arm hung in a black sling&mdash;and she clung to him
as though some one might take him away, and because
she was a woman, she wept in her moment of happiness.
Her <i>Mann</i> had come home....</p>

<p>Forgetting the dinner we were to have eaten in the
Lübeck station, we finally heeded a trainman's warning
and turned back to our car. There remained etched in
my mind the line of pallid, apprehensive faces, the tiny
waving flags, the little woman and the big man. It was
my first sight of war.</p>

<p>From Lübeck to Hamburg the ride was uneventful.
The hour was not late and beyond remarking that the
towns through which we passed were not as brilliantly
lighted as usual, the courier could from the car window
observe no difference between the Germany of peace
and of war. Here and there we noticed bridges and trestles
patroled by <i>Landwehr</i> and outside our compartment
we read the handbill requesting every passenger to aid
the government in preventing spies throwing explosives
from the car windows. From the conductor we learned
that there had been such attempts to delay the passage of
troop trains. Whereupon we congratulated ourselves
upon buying the conductor, as we had the compartment to
ourselves. One thought of what would have happened
had there been an excitable German in with us and while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the train was crossing a bridge, we had innocently opened
a window for air!</p>

<p>It was almost ten when the close, clustered lights of
Hamburg closed in against the trackside and we caught
our first glimpse of the swarming <i>Bahnhof</i>. Soldiers
everywhere. The blue of the Reservists, the gray-green
of the Regulars&mdash;a shifting tide of color swept the length
of the long platforms, rising against the black slopes of
countless staircases, overrunning the vast halls above,
increasing, as car after car emptied its load. And then,
as at Lübeck, we saw white bandages coming down under
cloth-covered helmets and caps, or arms slung in black
slings; the slightly wounded were coming in from the
western front.</p>

<p>All this time we had forgotten the Englishman, and
it was with a start that we recalled him.</p>

<p>"If he spots us," advised my companion, "we've got
to hand him the cold shoulder. Mark my words, he'll try
to trail along to the same hotel and stick like a leech."</p>

<p>Again he was right. At the baggage room the Englishman
overtook us, suggesting that we make a party
of it&mdash;he knew a gay café&mdash;first going to the hotel. He
suggested the <i>Atlantic</i>. Bluntly he was informed we
were visiting friends, but nothing would do then but
we must agree to meet him in, say, an hour. Not until
he found it an impossibility did he give us up and finally,
with marvelous good nature, he said good night. The
last I saw of him was his broad back disappearing through
a door into a street.</p>

<p>The courier nudged me.</p>

<p>"Quick," he whispered, "look,&mdash;the man going out the
next door."</p>

<p>Before I could turn I knew whom he meant. I saw
only the man's profile before he, too, disappeared into the
street; but it was a face difficult to forget, for it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
close to me at Warnemunde; it was the face of the police
spy.</p>

<p>"I told you they purposely let him get through," continued
my friend. "That police fellow must have come
down on the train from Warnemunde. I tell you it's
best not to pick up with any one these days. Suppose
we had fallen for that Englishman and gone to a café
with him to-night&mdash;a nice mess!"</p>

<p>It was in a restaurant a few hours later that I saw my
first Iron Cross, black against a gray-green coat and
dangling from a button. In <i>Bieber's</i>, a typical better
class café of the new German type, luxurious with its
marble walls and floors, and with little soft rugs underfoot
and colored wicker tables and chairs, one felt the
new spirit of this miracle of nations. On the broad landing
of a wide marble staircase an orchestra played soldier
songs and above the musicians, looking down on his people,
loomed a bust of Wilhelm II, <i>Von Gottes Gnaden,
Kaiser von Deutschland</i>. About him, between the flags
of Austria-Hungary and Turkey, blazed the black, white,
and red, and there where all might read, hung the proclamation
of August to the German people. We had read
it through to the last line: "<i>Forward with God who will
be with us as he was with our Fathers!</i>"&mdash;when we heard
an excited inflection in the murmurings from the many
tables&mdash;"<i>Das Eiserne Kreuz!</i>" And we saw the officer
from whose coat dangled the black maltese cross, outlined
in silver. His cheeks flushed, proud of a limping, shot-riddled
leg, proud of his Emperor's decoration, but
prouder still that he was a German; he must have forgotten
all of battle and suffering during that brief walk
between the tables. Cheers rang out, then a song, and
when finally the place quieted everybody stared at that
little cross of black as though held by some hypnotic
power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>So! We were Americans, he said when we finally were
presented. That was good. We&mdash;that is&mdash;I had come to
write of the war as seen from the German side. Good,
<i>sehr gut</i>! He had heard the Allies, especially the English,&mdash;<i>Verfluchte
Englanderschwein!</i>&mdash;were telling many
lies in the American newspapers. How could any intelligent
man believe them?</p>

<p>In his zeal for the German cause his Iron Cross, his
one shattered leg, the consciousness that he was a hero,
all were forgotten. Of course I wanted to hear his
story&mdash;the story of that little piece of metal hanging
from the black and white ribbon on his coat&mdash;but tenaciously
he refused. That surprised me until I knew
Prussian officers.</p>

<p>So we left the man with the Iron Cross, marveling not
at his modesty but that it embodied the spirit of the
German army; whereas I thought I knew that spirit. But
not until the next night, when I left Hamburg behind,
where every one was pretending to be busy and the
nursemaids and visitors were still tossing tiny fish to the
wintering gulls in the upper lake; not until the train
was bringing me to Berlin did I understand what it
meant. At the stations I went out and walked with
the passengers and watched the crowds; I talked with
a big business man of Hamburg&mdash;bound for Berlin because
he had nothing to do in Hamburg; then it was I
faintly began to grasp the tremendous emotional upheaval
rumbling in every Germanic soul.</p>


<p>V&mdash;STORY OF THE SOLDIERS IN BERLIN</p>

<p>My first impression of Berlin was the long cement
platform gliding by, a dazzling brilliance of great arc
lamps and a rumbling chorus of song. Pulling down the
compartment window I caught the words "<i>Wir kämpfen</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<i>Mann für Mann, für Kaiser and Reich!</i>" And leaning
out I could see down at the other end of the Friederichstrasse
Station a regiment going to the front.</p>

<p>Flowers bloomed from the long black tubes from which
lead was soon to pour; wreaths and garlands hung from
cloth-covered helmets; cartridge belts and knapsacks were
festooned with ferns. The soldiers were all smoking;
cigars and cigarettes had been showered upon them with
prodigal hand. Most of them held their guns in one hand
and packages of delicacies in the other; and they were
climbing into the compartments or hanging out of the
windows singing, always singing, in the terrific German
way. Later I was to learn that they went into battle
with the "<i>Wacht am Rhein</i>" on their lips and a wonderful
trust in God in their hearts.</p>

<p>I felt that trust now. I saw it in the confident face
of the young private who hung far out of the compartment
in order to hold his wife's hand. It was not the way
a conscript looks. This soldier's blue eyes sparkled as
with a holy cause, and as I watched this man and wife
I marveled at their sunny cheer. I saw that each was
wonderfully proud of the other and that this farewell was
but an incident in the sudden complexity of their lives.
The Fatherland had been attacked: her man must be a
hero. It was all so easy, so brimming with confidence.
Of course he would come back to her.... You believed
in the Infinite ordering of things that he would.</p>

<p>Walking on down the platform I saw another young
man. They were all young, strapping fellows in their
new uniforms of field gray. He was standing beside the
train; he seemed to want to put off entering the car
until the last minute. He was holding a bundle of something
white in his arms, something that he hugged to his
face and kissed, while the woman in the cheap furs wept,
and I wondered if it was because of the baby she cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
while that other childless young wife had smiled.</p>

<p>Back in the crowd I saw a little woman with white
hair; she was too feeble to push her way near the train.
She was dabbing her eyes and waving to a big, mustached
man who filled a compartment door and who
shouted jokes to her. And almost before they all could
realize it, the train was slipping down the tracks; the
car windows filled with singing men, the long gray platform
suddenly shuffling to the patter of men's feet, as
though they would all run after the train as far as they
could go. But the last car slipped away and the last
waving hand fell weakly against a woman's side. They
seemed suddenly old, even the young wife, as they slowly
walked away. Theirs was not the easiest part to play in
the days of awful waiting while the young blood of the
nation poured out to turn a hostile country red.</p>

<p>I thought I had caught the German spirit at Lübeck
and at the café in Hamburg when the hero of the Iron
Cross had declined to tell me his tale; but this sensation
that had come with my setting foot on the Berlin station&mdash;this
was something different. Fifteen hundred men
going off to what?&mdash;God only knows!&mdash;fifteen hundred
virile types of this nation of virility; and they had laughed
and they had sung, and they had kissed their wives and
brothers and babies as though these helpless ones should
only be proud that their little household was helping their
Fatherland and their Emperor. Self? It was utterly
submerged. On that station platform I realized that there
is but one self in all Germany to-day and that is the soul
of the nation. Nothing else matters; a sacrifice is commonplace.
Wonderful? Yes. But then we Americans
fought that way at Lexington; any nation can fight that
way when it is a thing of the heart; and this war is all
of the heart in Germany. As we walked through the
station gates I understood why three million Socialists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
who had fought their Emperor in and out of the Reichstag,
suddenly rallied to his side, agreeing "I know no
parties, only Germans." I felt as I thought of the young
faces of the soldiers, cheerfully starting down into the
unknown hell of war, that undoubtedly among their number
were Socialists. In this national crisis partisan allegiance
counted for nothing, they had ceased dealing
with the Fatherland in terms of the mind and gave to
it only the heart.</p>

<p>Even in Berlin I realized that war stalks down strange
by-paths. It forever makes one feel the incongruous.
It disorders life in a monstrous way. I have seen it in
an instant make pictures that the greatest artist would
have given his life to have done. It likes to deal in
contrasts; it is jolting....</p>

<p>With General von Loebell I walked across the Doeberitz
camp, which is near Berlin. At Doeberitz new
troops were being drilled for the front. We walked towards
a dense grove of pines above which loomed the
sky, threateningly gray. Between the trees I saw the flash
of yellow flags; a signal squad was drilling. Skirting
the edge of the woods we came to a huge, cleared indentation
where twenty dejected English prisoners were
leveling the field for a parade ground. On the left I
saw an opening in the trees; a wagon trail wound away
between the pines. And then above the rattling of the
prisoners' rakes I heard the distant strains of a marching
song that brought a lump to my throat. Back there
in the woods somewhere, some one had started a song;
and countless voices took up the chorus; and through the
trees I saw a moving line of gray-green and down the
road tramped a company of soldiers. They were all singing
and their boyish voices blended with forceful beauty.
"In the Heimat! In the Heimat!" It was the favorite
medley of the German army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The prisoners stopped work; unconsciously some of
those dispirited figures in British khaki stiffened. And
issuing from the woods in squads of fours, all singing,
tramped the young German reserves, swinging along not
fifteen feet from the prison gang in olive drab&mdash;"In the
Heimat!" And out across the Doeberitz plains they
swung, big and snappy.</p>

<p>"They're ready," remarked General von Loebell.
"They've just received their field uniforms."</p>

<p>And then there tramped out of the woods another
company, and another, two whole regiments, the last
thundering "<i>Die Wacht am Rhein</i>," and we went near
enough to see the pride in their faces, the excitement in
their eyes; near enough to see the Englishmen, young
lads, too, who gazed after the swinging column with a
soldier's understanding, but being prisoners and not allowed
to talk, they gave no expression to their emotions
and began to scrape their rakes over the hard
ground....</p>


<p>VI&mdash;STORY OF "THE HALL OF AWFUL
DOUBT"</p>

<p>I stood on the Dorotheenstrasse looking up at the old
red brick building which before the second of August in
this year of the world war was the War Academy. I had
heard that when tourists come to Berlin they like to
watch the gay uniformed officers ascending and descending
the long flights of gray steps; for there the cleverest
of German military youths are schooled for the General
Staff. Like the tourists, I stood across the street to-day
and watched the old building and the people ascending
or descending the long flights of gray steps. Only I saw
civilians, men alone and in groups, women with shawls
wrapped around their heads, women with yellow topped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
boots, whose motors waited beside the curb, and children,
clinging to the hands of women, all entering or
leaving by the gray gate; some of the faces were happy
and others were wet with tears, and still others stumbled
along with heavy steps. For this old building on Dorotheenstrasse
is no longer the War Academy; it is a place
where day after day hundreds assemble to learn the fate
of husband, kin or lover. For inside the gray gate sits
the Information Bureau of the War Ministry, ready to
tell the truth about every soldier in the German army!
I, too, went to learn the truth.</p>

<p>I climbed a creaking staircase and went down a creaking
hall. I met the Count von Schwerin, who is in
charge. I found myself in a big, high-ceilinged room
the walls of which were hung with heroic portraits of
military dignitaries. My first impression was of a wide
arc of desks that circling from wall to wall seemed to
be a barrier between a number of gentle-spoken, elderly
gentlemen and a vague mass of people that pressed forward.
The anxious faces of all these people reminded
me of another crowd that I had seen&mdash;the crowd outside
the White Star offices in New York when the <i>Titanic</i>
went down. And I became conscious that the decorations
of this room which, the Count was explaining, was
the Assembly Hall of the War Academy, were singularly
appropriate&mdash;the pillars and walls of gray marble, oppressively
conveying a sense of coldness, insistent cold, like
a tomb, and all around you the subtle presence of death,
the death of hopes. It was the Hall of Awful Doubt.</p>

<p>And as I walked behind the circle of desks I learned
that these men of tact and sympathy, too old for active
service, were doing their part in the war by helping to
soften with kindly offices the blow of fate. I stood behind
them for some few moments and watched, although
I felt like one trespassing upon the privacy of grief. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
saw in a segment of the line a fat, plain-looking woman,
with a greasy child clinging to her dress, a white-haired
man with a black muffler wrapped around his neck, a
veiled woman, who from time to time begged one of the
elderly clerks to hurry the news of her husband, and then
a wisp of a girl in a cheap, rose-colored coat, on whose
cheeks two dabs of rouge burned like coals.</p>

<p>Soldiers from the Berlin garrison were used there as
runners. At the bidding of the gentle old men they
hastened off with the inquiry to one of the many filing
rooms and returned with the news. This day there was
a new soldier on duty; he was new to the Hall of Awful
Doubt.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine what is keeping him so long," I
heard an elderly clerk tell the woman with the veil.
"He'll come any minute.... There he is now. Excuse
me, please."</p>

<p>And the elderly clerk hurried to meet the soldier,
wanting to intercept the news, if it were bad, and break
it gently. But as he caught sight of the clerk I saw the
soldier click his heels and, as if he were delivering a
message to an officer, his voice boomed out: "<i>Tot!</i>" ...
Dead!</p>

<p>And the woman with the veil gave a little gasp, a
long, low moan, and they carried her to another room;
and as I left the gray room, with the drawn, anxious
faces pushing forward for their turns at the black-covered
desks, I realized the heart-rending sacrifice of the
women of France, Belgium, Russia, England, Servia, and
Austria, who, like these German mothers, wives, sweethearts,
had been stricken down in the moment of hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>


<p>VII&mdash;STORY OF A NIGHT IN BERLIN</p>

<p>That night I went to the Jägerstrasse, to Maxim's.
The place is everything the name suggests; one of those
Berlin cafés that open when the theaters are coming out
and close when the last girl has smiled and gone off with
the last man. I sat in a white and gold room with a
cynical German surgeon, listening to his comments.</p>

<p>"It is the best in town now," he explained. "All the
Palais de Danse girls come here. Don't be in a hurry.
I know what you want for your articles. You'll see it
soon."</p>

<p>Maxim's, like most places of the sort, was methodically
banal. But one by one officers strolled in and soon a
piano struck up the notes of a patriotic song. When the
music began the girls left the little tables where they had
been waiting for some man to smile, and swarmed around
the piano, singing one martial song upon another, while
officers applauded, drank their healths, and asked them
to sing again.</p>

<p>Time passed and the girls sang on, flushed and savage
as the music crashed to the cadenzas of war. What were
the real emotions of these subjects of Germany; had the
war genuine thrills for them? I had talked with decent
women of all classes about the war; what of the women
whose hectic lives had destroyed real values?</p>

<p>"Get one of those girls over here," I told the surgeon,
"and ask her what she thinks of the war."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean it?" he said with a cynical smile.</p>

<p>"Surely. This singing interests me. I wonder what's
back of it?"</p>

<p>He called one of them. "Why not sing?" Hilda said
with a shrug. "What else? There are few men here
now and there are fewer every night. What do I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of this war? My officer's gone to the front without leaving
me enough to keep up the apartment. <i>Krieg? Krieg
ist schrecklich!</i> War is terrible!"</p>

<p>My German friend was laughing.</p>

<p>"War?" he smiled. "And you thought it was going
to change that kind."</p>

<p>But I was thinking of the woman with the veil whom
I had seen in the Hall of Awful Doubt; and outside the
night air felt cool and clean....</p>

<p>But my symbol of Berlin is not these things&mdash;not bustling
streets filled with motors, swarming with able-bodied
men whom apparently the army did not yet need. Its
summation is best expressed by the varied sights and
emotions of an afternoon in mid-December.</p>

<p>Lodz has fallen; again Hindenburg has swept back the
Russian hordes. Black-shawled women call the extras.
Berlin rises out of its calmness and goes mad. Magically
the cafés fill.... I am walking down a side street.
I see people swarming toward a faded yellow brick
church. They seem fired with a zealot's praise. I go in
after them and see them fall on their knees.... They
are thanking Him for the Russian rout.... Wondering
I go out. I come to another church. Its aisles are
black with bowed backs; the murmur of prayer drones
like bees; a robed minister is intoning:</p>

<p>"Oh, Almighty Father, we thank Thee that Thou art
with us in our fight for the right; we thank Thee
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It is very quiet in there. War seems a thing incredibly
far away. The sincerity of these people grips your heart.
I feel as I never felt in church before. Something mysteriously
big and reverent stirs all around.... Then outside
in the street drums rattle, feet thump. A regiment
is going to the front! I hurry to see it go by, but back
in the church the bowed forms pray on.</p>

<p>(This American observer now leaves Berlin to go to
the battle-front with the German armies. He continues
to narrate his experiences in some of the world's greatest
battles. He tells the first complete account of the great
battle of Augustowo Wald in which the Russian army of
240,000 men was annihilated, and how he was a guest of
honor at the "Feast of Victory.")</p>

<h2>THE "EMDEN"&mdash;AN EPIC OF THE
GREAT WAR</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Experiences Aboard a Gallant Little Fighting
Ship</i><br />
<br />
<i>By Kapitanleutnant Hellmuth Von Mücke, of His
Emperor's Ship, The "Emden"&mdash;Translated
by Helene S. White</i>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>The tale of the <i>Emden</i> is one of the greatest sea stories in all
history. Fighting its way through the China Seas, into the
Bay of Bengal, and across the Indian Ocean, knowing that
sooner or later it must face death, the crew of this gallant ship
defeated and captured twenty-four enemy ships, destroying cargoes
and property valued at $10,000,000&mdash;in two months roving
the high seas. The romantic voyage began on September 10th
and ended on November 9th, 1914. It was a crew of "jolly
good fellows" that sailed under Commander von Müller; their
adventures won the admiration not only of their enemies but of
the whole world. An authentic story of this epic of the seas is
told by Lieutenant Captain von Mücke, of the <i>Emden</i> in a
volume relating its exploits. He has also written a book bearing
on the adventures of the landing squad in "The Ayesha."
There is nothing more sensationally adventuresome in fiction
than these voyages. The most improbable romance is outdone
by the exploits of the gallant German seamen. Commander von
Müller of the <i>Emden</i> is a prisoner of war in England at the
time that these accounts are written. Selections are here given
from the volume on the <i>Emden</i>, with permission of the publishers,

I&mdash;STORY OF ADVENTURES ON THE
YELLOW SEA</p>

<p>"All hands aft," shrilled the whistles of the boatswain's
mate through all the ship's decks. Quickly all
the officers and crew assembled on the after deck.
Everyone knew what it was for.</p>

<p>It was at two o'clock on the afternoon of the second
day of August, 1914, while our ship lay far out in the
Yellow Sea, that Captain von Mueller appeared on the
poop, holding in his hand a slip of paper such as is used
for messages by wireless. In eager expectancy three
hundred pairs of eyes were fixed upon the lips of our
Commander as he began to speak.</p>

<p>"The following wireless message has just been received
from Tsingtao: 'On August first, his Majesty, the Emperor,
ordered the mobilization of the entire land and
naval forces of the Empire. Russian troops have crossed
the border into Germany. As a consequence, the Empire
is at war with Russia and with France...."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three cheers for his Majesty, the Emperor, rang out
over the broad surface of the Yellow Sea. Then came
the order that sent every man to his post,&mdash;"Clear ship
for action."</p>

<p>And so it had come to pass&mdash;the war was upon us!...</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Guns ready!" "Torpedo service ready!" "Engines
and auxiliary engines ready!" "Leak service ready!"
"Steering service ready!" "Signal and wireless service
ready!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>Rapidly, one after the other, the reports from all over
the ship were now coming in, and demanded my attention
to the exclusion of all further thought and reflection.
A quick tour of inspection through the ship assured
me that all was in readiness, and I could report
to our Commander, "The ship is clear for action."</p>

<p>At a speed of fifteen nautical miles we were proceeding
toward the Strait of Tchusima. When darkness came
on, the war watch was begun on the <i>Emden</i>, which is
done in the following manner: Half of the men of the
crew remain awake and on duty at their posts,&mdash;at the
guns, at the searchlights and lookouts, in the torpedo
room, in the engine and fire rooms, etc., while the others
are allowed to go to sleep with their clothes on, and
ready, at a moment's notice, to get to their posts. The
commander of the ship takes charge of one of these
watches, and the other one is in command of the first
officer.</p>

<p>After passing through the Strait of Tchusima, the
<i>Emden</i> steered northward. There was no moon, and
the night was pitch black. It was too dark to see anything
even in our immediate vicinity. We were, of
course, traveling with all lights screened. Not a ray of
light was allowed to escape from the ship, nor the least
bit of smoke from her funnels. There was a moderate
sea running, and the water was unusually bright with
phosphorescence. The water churned up by our screws
stretched away behind the ship in a shimmering wake of
light green. The waves dashing high up against the
bow, and the water tumbling and breaking against the
sides, splashed the whole ship with a phosphorescent glitter,
and made her appear as though she had been dipped
into molten gold of a greenish hue. Occasionally, there
appeared in the water large shining spots of great length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
so that a number of times the lookouts reported undersea
boats in sight.</p>

<p>At four o'clock in the morning the port war watch,
which I commanded, was relieved. The Commander
now took charge. The day was just dawning. I had
just gone to my cabin, and had lain down to rest, when I
was wakened by the shrill call of the alarm bells and
the loud noise of many hurrying feet. "Clear ship for
action," the order went echoing from room to room. In
an instant everyone was at his post. Were we really to
be so fortunate as to fall in, on our very first day, with
one of the Russian or French ships that had been reported
to us as being in the vicinity of Vladivostok?</p>

<p>By the trembling of the ship we could tell that the
engine had been put on high speed. In the gray of the
early morning we sighted, ahead of us and a little to
the right, a vessel somewhat larger than our own, which
was also traveling with screened lights, and looked like
a man-of-war. Our commander ordered a course toward
her at high speed. Hardly had she seen us when she
turned hard about, took the contrary course, and ran
away from us, the dense column of smoke rising from
her funnels indicating that her engines were working
at maximum power. The pursued ship took a course
directly toward the Japanese Islands, lying about ten miles
distant. A black cloud of smoke streamed behind her,
rested on the water, and, for a while, hid her from sight
entirely. We could see nothing of her but the mast tops,
and so found it impossible to discover the nature of the
vessel with which we were dealing. That she was not
a neutral was evident enough from her behavior. Therefore,
after her with full speed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF CAPTURE OF THE RUSSIAN
"RJESAN"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, daylight had come. The signal: "Stop
at once!" was flying at our foremast. When this demand
was not complied with after a reasonable time, we
fired a blind shell, and when this also failed to have the
desired effect, we sent a quick reminder in the form of
a couple of sharp shots after her. The fleeing ship could
no longer hope to reach the neutral waters of Japan.
When our shots fell into the water close beside her, she
stopped, turned, and set the Russian colors in all her topmasts.
So, on the very first night after the war had
begun, we had taken our first prize. It was the Russian
volunteer steamer <i>Rjesan</i>. In time of peace she had
plied as a passenger steamer between Shanghai and Vladivostok.
She was now to be armed with guns and to
serve as an auxiliary cruiser. She was a speedy and
very new ship, built in the German ship yards of Schichau.</p>

<p>In the sea that was running, the <i>Emden</i> and her prize
rolled badly. It was therefore no easy matter to get the
cutter, that was to carry the prize crew from the <i>Emden</i>
to the <i>Rjesan</i>, into the water. There was danger that it
would be pounded to pieces against the sides of the ships.
However, everything passed off satisfactorily. In a short
time we saw the officer of the prize crew, followed by a
number of men, all armed with pistols, climbing up the
gangway ladder. The Russian flag was hauled down, and
in its place the German colors were run up.</p>

<p>As the steamer was one that could serve our own purposes
excellently well&mdash;she could be transformed into a
very good German auxiliary cruiser&mdash;our commander decided
not to destroy her, but instead to take her to Tsingtao.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
At a speed of fifteen miles we made our way southward.
Behind us, in our wake, followed the <i>Rjesan</i>. A
commanding officer with a prize crew of twelve men remained
aboard of her, to make certain that the service of
the ship and the engines, etc., would be according to our
wishes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the newspapers, we had learned that the main
body of the French fleet, consisting of the armored
cruisers <i>Montcalm</i> and <i>Dupleix</i>, besides a number of torpedo
boat destroyers, was lying somewhere off Vladivostok.
With these ships the <i>Emden</i> must not be allowed
to come in contact by daylight. As we were rounding
the southern extremity of Corea, the look-out in the
top suddenly sang out, "Seven smoke clouds in sight
astern!" To make quite sure of it, the Commander sent
me aloft. I, too, could distinctly see seven separate columns
of smoke, together with the upper structure of a
small vessel, the one nearest to us, just above the horizon.
Upon hearing my report, the commander gave orders to
change our course. We swept a wide circle, and so
avoided the enemy. Without meeting with hindrance of
any kind, we arrived at Tsingtao.</p>

<p>On the way we caught up an interesting wireless message.
The Reuter Agency, so celebrated for its rigid
adherence to facts, was sending a telegram abroad, informing
the credulous world that the <i>Emden</i> had been
sunk. How many sympathetic people must have shuddered
as they read,&mdash;and so did we, of course!</p>

<p>During the following night, our prize occasioned us
some further trouble. Naturally, her lights, as well as
our own, had to be screened. It was a much easier matter
to give orders to that effect, however, than to see to
it that they were carried out. On the steamer were several
women passengers, who, from the outset, were filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
with mortal terror as to what the barbarous Germans
would do with them. Most of them were fat Russian
Jewesses. Every few minutes they would turn on the
electric lights in their cabins, so that finally there was
nothing left for the officer of the prize crew to do but
to have the electric light cable in the engine capped....</p>


<p>III&mdash;IN THE HARBOR AT TSINGTAO</p>

<p>At Tsingtao our commander found orders awaiting
him from the Admiral of our squadron, Count von Spee,
who, with the armored cruisers, <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i>,
and the small cruiser, <i>Nürnberg</i>, was in the South
Pacific, steering northward. The <i>Emden's</i> orders were
to join this squadron at a stated point of meeting in the
South Pacific.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At sunrise on the following day the <i>Emden</i> left Tsingtao
in the company of a large number of German ships,
all bound for the south, where they were to join the Admiral's
squadron.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With fair weather and a smooth sea the <i>Emden</i> slipped
out of the harbor moles. Our band played "The Watch
on the Rhine." The entire crew was on deck, singing as
the band played. Cheers rang from ship to shore, and
back again. Everyone was confident and in high spirits.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cautiously the <i>Emden</i> made her way between the mines
which barred the entrance to the harbor. The sun had
just risen. Behind us lay Tsingtao, the gem of the far
East, brightened by the golden-red beams of the young
day&mdash;a picture of peace....</p>

<p>As we gazed, there was not one of us who was not
conscious of a strange tugging at his heart. But duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
called with an imperative voice. Therefore, farewell to
the fair scene we were leaving behind us! For us, it was,
"Onward, to the South!"</p>

<p>We were accompanied by the <i>Markomannia</i>, the other
ships taking different courses. The <i>Markomannia</i> remained
our faithful companion for a number of months.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On our way to the South Pacific we learned, by wireless,
of the rupture in the relations between Germany and
England, and of the latter's declaration of war.</p>

<p>A few days later we learned of Japan's remarkable
ultimatum, without its causing us any special anxiety. It
might as well all be done up at one and the same time,
was the general feeling among us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the twelfth of August, in the evening, we had
reached the vicinity of the island where we were to join
our cruiser squadron, and soon we fell in with some
of the ships that were serving as outposts. As we approached
the group of assembled warships, we saw the
stanch cruisers <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i> lying in the
midst of them, each with a coal tender alongside, and
engaged in coaling. To the left lay the slender <i>Nürnberg</i>,
also busy with taking on coal. Distributed about the bay,
many larger and smaller auxiliary ships and tenders of
the squadron could be seen. The <i>Emden</i> was ordered to
an anchorage close beside the flagship, in the right-hand
half of the bay. Rousing cheers were sent from deck
to deck, as we passed by the other ships, and soon our
anchor rattled seaward, and to the bottom,&mdash;it was to be
the last time for many a long day.</p>

<p>Our commander went aboard the flagship to report
to the Admiral of the squadron, and to submit to him the
proposal that the <i>Emden</i> be detached from the squadron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and be sent to the Indian Ocean, to raid the enemy's
commerce.</p>

<p>On the following day the squadron steered an easterly
course, the ships keeping a long line, one behind the other,
with all the coal tenders bringing up the rear. The Admiral
had, for the present, reserved his decision with
regard to our Commander's proposition, and we were all
impatient to learn what it would be. At last, toward
noon, signal flags were seen running up on the flagship.
They read, "<i>Emden</i> detached. Wish you good luck!"
Sweeping a wide curve, the <i>Emden</i> withdrew from the
long line of warships, a signal conveying her Commander's
thanks for the good wishes of the Admiral fluttering
at her mast head. There was still another signal from
the commanding officer of the squadron, ordering the
<i>Markomannia</i> to attend the <i>Emden</i>. Ere long we had
lost sight of the other ships of the squadron, which now
were steering a course contrary to our own, and we all
knew full well that we should never meet again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These days were strenuous ones for our men, as the
war watch was continued without intermission, in order
that the ship might be ready at a moment's notice for
any emergency. There was no opportunity to give the
crew even a short season of rest. For us, there was not
one harbor of refuge where we might lie free from danger....</p>

<p>To reach the open sea, our course now led us through
a number of narrow water ways. These straits swarmed
with fishing boats and other small sea craft. The nights
were bright with moonlight, which made it possible to
recognize the <i>Emden</i> at a considerable distance. To
meet so many boats was a source of anxiety to our Commander,
who expressed himself as apprehensive that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
presence in these waters, and our probable course also,
would be noised about by some of these vessels. All
English ships have either two or four funnels, whereas
the <i>Emden</i> had three.</p>

<p>The happy thought came to me that much might be
gained if the <i>Emden</i> were provided with a fourth funnel....</p>

<p>Out of wooden laths and sail-cloth we soon had constructed
a funnel of most elegant appearance, and, when
it had been placed in position, the <i>Emden</i> was the exact
counterpart of the British cruiser <i>Yarmouth</i>....</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF EXPLOITS ON THE BAY OF
BENGAL</p>

<p>In this way, by the end of the first week in September,
we had got as far as the Bay of Bengal. For a period
of about five days an English man-of-war, most
likely the <i>Minotaur</i>, kept a course close beside our own,
which we learned from the frequent wireless messages
that we caught up. Gradually, her messages became less
distinct, and then ceased altogether. At no time had she
come within sight of us.</p>

<p>It was not until the night of September tenth that
our work began in real earnest. A steamer came in sight,
and we approached her very cautiously, so as to give her
a closer inspection. Quietly, and with lights screened,
we crept up behind our intended victim. Our Commander
ordered an approach to within one hundred
meters of the steamer, which was peacefully and unsuspectingly
proceeding on her course, and, after the manner
of merchantmen, was paying little heed to anything
except what was ahead of her and showing lights. Suddenly,
through the stillness of the perfectly calm night,
rang out our challenge through the speaking trumpet:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stop at once! Do not use your wireless! We are
sending a boat!"</p>

<p>The steamer did not seem to realize what was meant
by this order. Perhaps she did not expect, here in the
heart of Indian waters, to run across an enemy's man-of-war.
Or she may have thought it the voice of a sea god,
and therefore no concern of hers. At any rate, she continued
on her way undeterred. So, to explain the situation,
we sent a blank shot whizzing past her. This
made an impression, and, pell mell, her engines were reversed&mdash;we
truly regretted the start we had given her
dozing engineers&mdash;and with her siren she howled out
her willingness to obey our order.</p>

<p>One of our cutters, with a prize crew in it, glided
swiftly to water, and thence to the steamer, of which we
thus took possession. An unpleasant surprise was now
in store for us, for soon there came flashing back to us
a signal given by one of the men of our prize crew:
"This is the Greek steamer, <i>Pontoporros</i>." ...</p>

<p>The <i>Pontoporros</i> was loaded with coal from India, the
very dirtiest coal in the world....</p>

<p>I had, in jest, entreated our Commander to capture,
as our first prize, a ship loaded with soap, instead of
which we now got this cargo of dirty Indian coal. My
disappointment was so great that I could not refrain
from reproachfully calling our Commander's attention to
it, and, with a laugh, he promised to do his best toward
providing us with the much-needed soap. And he kept
his word.</p>

<p>On the morning of the eleventh of September, only
a few hours after we had made the first addition to our
squadron, there appeared, forward, a large steamer,
which, in the supposition that we were an English man-of-war,
manifested her delight at meeting us by promptly
running up a large English flag while still a long way off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
We could not help wondering what sort of expression
her captain's face wore when we ran up the German colors,
and politely requested him to remain with us for a
while.</p>

<p>The steamer hailed from Calcutta, had been requisitioned
to serve as an English transport for carrying troops
from Colombo to France, and was fitted out with an
abundance of excellent supplies....</p>

<p>We also found aboard the ship a very handsome race
horse. By a shot through the head, this noble creature
was spared the agony of death by drowning. But our
sympathy was hardly sufficient to extend to all the many
mounts for artillery, which occupied as many neatly numbered
stalls that had been built into the ship. They had
to be left to become the prey of sharks a half hour later.
The ship's crew was sent aboard our "junkman."...</p>

<p>During the next few days our business flourished. It
was carried on in this way: As soon as a steamer came
in sight, she was stopped, and one of our officers, accompanied
by ten men, was sent aboard her. It was their
duty to get the steamer ready to be sunk, and to arrange
for the safe transfer of the passengers and crew. As a
rule, while we were still occupied with this, the mast head
of the next ship would appear above the horizon. There
was no need of giving chase. When the next steamer had
come near enough to us, the <i>Emden</i> steamed off to meet
her, and sent her a friendly signal by which she was induced
to join our other previously captured ships. Again
an officer and men were sent off, boarded her, got her
ready to be sunk, and attended to the transfer of all
hands aboard her, etc., and, by the time this was accomplished,
the mast head of the third ship had usually come
in sight. Again the <i>Emden</i> went to meet her, and so the
game went on....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>


<p>V&mdash;SEA TALES FROM CEYLON TO CALCUTTA</p>

<p>In this way we cleaned up the whole region from Ceylon
to Calcutta. In addition to our old companion, the
<i>Markomannia</i>, we were now accompanied by the Greek
collier <i>Pontoporros</i>, which, in the meanwhile, had relinquished
the rôle of "junkman" to the <i>Cabigna</i>. The latter
was an English steamer carrying an American cargo,
the destruction of which would have resulted in nothing
but unnecessary charges.</p>

<p>The <i>Cabigna</i> continued with us for several days, although
she, the <i>Markomannia</i>, and the <i>Pontoporros</i> were
not the only companions of the <i>Emden</i> during that night.
We had captured more prizes, whose destruction, however,
was deferred to the following day in consideration
of the passengers, because of the darkness, and the high
seas running. All told, we had six attendants that night.
Three of these disappeared in the sea on the coming
morning, and the <i>Cabigna</i> was discharged to land her
passengers.</p>

<p>Aboard the <i>Cabigna</i> were the wife and little child of
the captain. The position at sea, where the other steamers
had been sent to the bottom, was so far distant from
the nearest shore that it would have been quite impossible
for any boats to have reached land. Before the
captain of the <i>Cabigna</i> had been told that he would be
allowed to proceed, and in the assumption that his ship
also was to be sunk, he begged that he might be allowed
to take a revolver with him for the protection of his wife
and child....</p>

<p>When the captain was informed that it was not our
purpose to destroy his ship, he was overcome with joy.
I, myself, was aboard his ship for several hours, and he
could not find words sufficient to express his gratitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
begging me to convey his thanks to our Commander, and
finally handing me a letter to deliver to him.</p>

<p>I had a long conversation with the captain's wife,
also, and she expressed sentiments much like those contained
in her husband's letter to our Commander. When
she discovered, from something I said, that my oil-skins
were going to pieces, she pressed me to accept her husband's.
Besides this, upon learning that our supply of
smoking tobacco was getting low, she urged us to take as
many cigarettes and as much smoking tobacco with us
as we could carry. These, she declared, were but trifling
gifts in comparison with the gratitude she felt. It is
hardly necessary to say that we took with us neither the
tobacco nor the oil-skins.</p>

<p>At the time that the <i>Cabigna</i> was discharged, her deck
was full of passengers, all people from the steamers we
had captured. At our order, "You may proceed!" three
cheers&mdash;"Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!"&mdash;rang back to
us, one for the Commander, one for the officers, and one
for the crew of H. M. S. <i>Emden</i>, in which every person
on the crowded deck joined.... There were, at the
time, about four hundred persons aboard the ship.</p>

<p>In the further progress of our activities we never failed
to get three cheers from our discharged "junkmen," as
they departed with their collection of passengers from
captured steamers....</p>

<p>This seems a fitting place to speak about the attitude
taken by the Englishmen when we captured their ships.
Most of them behaved very sensibly. After they had recovered
from the first shock of surprise, they usually
passed into the stage of unrestrained indignation at their
government, at which they swore roundly. With but one
exception, they never offered any resistance to the sinking
of their ships. We always allowed them time enough to
collect and take with them their personal possessions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
They usually devoted most of this time to making certain
that their precious supply of whiskey was not wasted on
the fishes. I can say with truth that seldom did we send
off a wholly sober lot of passengers on any one of our
"junkmen."</p>

<p>VI&mdash;TWO SHELLS AT MADRAS&mdash;AND AN
EXPLOSION</p>

<p>One captain was especially amusing. His was the unenviable
duty of taking a bucket-dredger from England
to Australia. No seafaring man can help sympathizing
with the unfortunate who has to conduct one of these
rolling tubs, with a speed of not more than four nautical
miles at best, all the way from Europe down to Australia.
And so, from a purely humane standpoint, we could fully
appreciate this English captain's joy at being captured.
Rarely have I seen anyone jump so high for joy. He
must have been a past master in the art of jumping to be
able to keep his feet in spite of the terrible rolling of his
ship. Tears of gratitude coursed down his weathered
cheeks as he exclaimed, "Thank God, that the old tub is
gone! The five hundred pounds I was to have for taking
her to Australia were paid me in advance."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the eighteenth of September, in the evening, the
<i>Emden</i> entered the harbor. It so happened that this was
the day after the one on which the joyful tidings of the
<i>Emden's</i> destruction had been officially announced. To
celebrate the happy occasion, a large company had assembled
for dinner at the Club. As we were not aware of
this, it was hardly our fault that the <i>Emden's</i> shells fell
into the soup. Had we known of the dinner party, we
would, of course, gladly have deferred our attack until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
another day, as it is the part of wisdom never to exasperate
the enemy unnecessarily. A due regard should
always be shown for sacred institutions, and <i>dinner</i> is
an institution with regard to which the English are always
keenly sensitive.</p>

<p>We approached to within 3,000 meters of Madras.
The harbor light was shining peacefully. It rendered us
good service as we steered toward shore, for which we
again take this opportunity to express our gratitude to
the British Indian government. A searchlight revealed to
us the object of our quest,&mdash;the oil tanks, painted white
and ornamented with a stripe of red. A couple of shells
sent in that direction, a quick upleaping of tongues of
bluish-yellow flame, streams of liquid fire pouring out
through the holes made by our shots, an enormous black
cloud of dense smoke,&mdash;and, following the advice of the
old adage, "A change is good for everybody," we had
sent several millions' worth of the enemy's property up
into the air, instead of down into the sea, as heretofore.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile the coaling question had come to be a
source of annoyance to us. Our faithful <i>Markomannia</i>
had no more coal to give us. To be sure, our prize, the
<i>Pontoporros</i>, with her cargo of coal from India, was still
with us. But this Indian coal is far from being desirable
fuel, as it not only clogs the fire kettles with dirt, but,
while it gives out a minimum of heat, it sends forth a
maximum of smoke, and so our prize was not an unmixed
joy to us. However, this vexed coal question was
happily solved for us by the English Admiralty in a most
satisfactory manner. Before many days had passed, a
fine large steamer of 7,000 tonnage, loaded with the best
of Welsh coal, en route for Hong Kong, and destined
for their own use, was relinquished to us by the English
in a most unselfish manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>So, for the present, we were most generously supplied
with the best of fuel, and all further anxiety on this account
was dismissed to the uncertain future. The captain
of our new coal-laden prize seemed to have no scruples
with regard to transferring himself, together with his
ship, into German service. Willingly and faithfully he
coöperated with the officer of the prize crew that was, of
course, placed in command of his ship, all the while cheerfully
whistling "Rule, Britannia."</p>

<p>In the meantime, even the English government itself
had become convinced that the destruction of the <i>Emden</i>
had, after all, not been accomplished.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p>VII&mdash;STORY OF LIFE ABOARD THE FLYING
DUTCHMAN</p>

<p>We knew quite well that sixteen hostile ships were in
pursuit of us,&mdash;British, French, and Japanese. We never
had any information with regard to the position of these
ships, nor of their character, which, after all, could matter
very little to us, since the <i>Emden</i> was the smallest and
least formidable of all the war ships in the Indian Ocean.
There was not a hostile cruiser, that she was likely to
meet, that was not her superior in strength. That the
<i>Emden's</i> career must soon be cut short was therefore a
prospect of which everyone aboard her felt certain.
Many hounds are certain death to the hare.</p>

<p>Our Commander had set this aspect of affairs before
us, sharply and clearly, at the very outset of the <i>Emden's</i>
career, pointing out that the only future ahead of the
<i>Emden</i> was to inflict as much damage as possible upon the
enemy before she herself should be destroyed, which, in
any event, could be but a question of time.</p>

<p>The devotion of the <i>Emden's</i> crew to their Commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
was touching in the extreme. The men appreciated the
high qualities of their leader, were proud of their ship,
and gloried in its successful career. If, at any time when
they were singing, or were otherwise noisy, the word was
passed along, "The Commander is tired," they would
become instantly quiet. At a word of encouragement
from him the men would accomplish some truly wonderful
feats in connection with difficult undertakings,
such as coaling at sea under most adverse conditions, and
in spite of extreme fatigue.</p>

<p>Of "<i>Emden</i> yarns" ... there was an untold number.
On board ship we kept a scrap-book in which they were
all preserved, but this, unfortunately, was lost, together
with much that was of higher value.</p>

<p>Amusement of a different nature was afforded the
officers' mess by our "war cats," as we called them. On
the day before we left Tsingtao a cat had come on board,
and so had come along with us. In course of time, this
cat experienced the joys of motherhood. Lying in my
hammock one morning, I opened my eyes upon a charming
scene of family life. Just beneath me, a little to one
side, on a mattress on the floor of the deck, lay Lieutenant
Schall, sleeping the sleep of the just. Close beside
him, on the same mattress, lay the cat, with a family of
five newly born kittens. After I had quickly wakened
the other officers who were sleeping near, so that they
might enjoy the sight of this peaceful domesticity, we
poked Lieutenant Schall until he, too, opened his eyes
upon the scene. At first he did not seem to share our
pleasure in it, however, but, with a muttered oath, hurried
off to the washroom.</p>

<p>Our kittens were not the only animals that the war
had brought aboard our ship. If some one had dropped
from the sky, and landed on the <i>Emden</i> on one of these
days, he would have opened his eyes in wonderment at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
sight of this "man-of-war." Forward, in the vicinity of
the drain pipe, he would have discovered one or two pigs,
grunting with satisfaction. Near by, he would have seen
a couple of lambs and a sheep or two, bleating peacefully.
By a walk aft he would, in all probability, have
scared up a whole flock of pigeons that had been sitting
on the rails which served for the transportation of ammunition,
and that, at his approach, would take refuge
in the pigeon house that had been fastened against one of
the funnels. In his further progress he would most likely
have frightened up a few dozen hens that would then
have run cackling about his heels, the noise they made
being only outdone by the still louder cackling of a flock
of geese engaged in unsuccessful attempts at swimming
in a large half-tub aft, and at the same time trying to
drink salt water. We always had a great deal of live
stock on board, all of which we had taken from the captured
steamers.... We had a less practical, but more
ornamental addition to our menagerie in a dwarf antelope,
which I came upon one day in the forward battery.
How the dainty creature got there has always remained
a mystery to me.</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;LAST DAYS OF THE GALLANT "EMDEN"</p>

<p>Every afternoon the ship's band gave us quite a long
concert. At such times the men all sat cozily about on
the forecastle, listening to the music, some joining in
with their voices, while others smoked or danced. In
the evening, after darkness had set in, the singers aboard
usually got together, and then every possible and impossible
song was sung by a chorus that was excellent
both in volume and quality. The "possible" songs were,
to a great extent, our beautiful German national melodies,
and these were always well rendered. The "impossible"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
ones were frequently improvised for the occasion.
In these, clearness of enunciation was always a
greater feature than either rhyme or rhythm. The singing
invariably closed with the "Watch on the Rhine," in
which all hands on deck joined.</p>

<p>Distributing the booty we had taken from a captured
ship was always an occasion about which centered a great
deal of interest. Anything of a useful nature, especially
everything in the line of food, was, as a matter of course,
taken aboard the <i>Emden</i>. As a result, veritable mountains
of canned goods were stored away in a place set
apart for them on the forward deck. Casks full of
delectable things were there. Hams and sausages dangled
down from the engine skylight. There were stacks of
chocolate and confectionery, and bottles labelled "Claret"
and "Cognac," with three stars....</p>

<p>So as to be able to do justice to all that fortune bestowed
upon us, an extra meal or two had to be tucked in
between the usual ones. So, with our afternoon coffee we
now had chocolate or bonbons. For the smokers there
were more than 250,000 cigarettes stored away, and when,
in the evening, they had been passed around, the deck
looked as though several hundred fireflies were flitting
about it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So we spent the passing days, while certain death
lurked round about us. In sixteen ships our enemies were
burning their coal, and racking their brains in vain attempt
to catch us.</p>

<p>(Here the Lieutenant-Captain of <i>The Flying Dutchman</i>
narrates the adventures of those wonderful days;
how they kept the enemy seas fraught with danger; how
they were hunted through the oceans; how they lived
their gay life of "gentlemen buccaneers," knowing that
each day brought them nearer to death and the bottom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the seas. He describes vividly "Our Baptism by Fire;"
he tells how they torpedoed the Russian destroyer
<i>Schemtschuk</i>; how they fought the French gunboat
<i>D'Iberville</i>; how they sunk the French destroyer <i>Mousquet</i>;
how they wrapped the French dead in the French
flag and buried them with naval honors in the sea; until
the last fight of the <i>Emden</i> when she met her champion,
the Anglo-Australian cruiser <i>Sydney</i> and went down gloriously
in the Indian Ocean. The Lieutenant-Captain's
description of this last fight is one of the classics of the
Great War.)</p>

<h2>"THE WAY OF THE CROSS"&mdash;A
TRAGEDY OF THE RUSSIANS</h2>

<div class="center"><i>The Millions Who Have Become Beggars</i><br />
<br />
<i>Told by V. Doroshevitch, Famous Russian Journalist</i>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>This is probably the first piece of Russian War literature translated
into English. It presents the terrible picture of the
Russian and Polish fugitives flying from the German invasion
in the autumn of 1915. The narrator is a famous Russian journalist,
who first contributed his experiences to the <i>Russkol
Slovl</i>. He went from Moscow to meet the incoming flood of
refugees and then passed through to the rear of the Russian
Army. At first he met the survivors who were forced ahead
in the procession; afterwards they came thicker and thicker
until they were a moving wall. He tells how they camped in
the forests, how they died by the way, how they put up their
crosses by the side of the road, how they sold their horses and
abandoned their carts, how they starved, how they suffered. His
articles have been collected by Stephen Graham and published
in book form by <i>G. P. Putnam's Sons</i>: Copyright 1916. These
breathless, desperate stories breathe a tender love. The style
is typically Slavic and has been preserved in the excellent translations.
A single typical story is here told of "The Desolation
of Roslavl" by permission of the publishers.</p></blockquote>


<p>In 1812 Moscow made a funeral pyre for herself,
and burned&mdash;for Russia's sake. A hundred years have
passed. And the red glare of Moscow's fire has paled.
The Moscow of those days! A wooden city. The burning
of it was appalling. The ground burned under the
feet of the Napoleonic soldiers: even the roadways of
Moscow were made of wood at that time.</p>

<p>But now! More than ten provinces have been laid
waste by the enemy. Millions of people have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
beggars. And have fled. From the places of their birth
to the far centre of Russia stretches the way of the Cross
for these people.</p>

<p>And on this way, as on that other way&mdash;of Golgotha,
are places, where the people faint under the burden of
the Cross: Bobruisk! Dovsk! Roslavl! These are names
full of affliction. Especially: The memory of Roslavl is
terrible.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
I&mdash;STORY OF DESOLATION OF ROSLAVL</p>

<p>Roslavl, on the River Oster, is a quiet little town in
the province of Smolensk. Ordinarily, when you drive
along the high-road coming from the West, in Rogachef,
in Cherikof, in Propoisk, in Krichef, they will tell you
that Roslavl is the first Russian town. From here to the
eastward, Great Russia begins.</p>

<p>When you arrive at Roslavl you will be awakened in
the morning by the soft yet powerful baritone of its
marvellous bell, sounding from the height of the Transfiguration
monastery on the hill.</p>

<p>And you will hear this, like music&mdash;for the first time
on the whole of your journey from the West up till then.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now Roslavl is choked and drowned. There is neither
sugar nor salt in the town. In the streets fugitives stop
you and ask,</p>

<p>"Friend, where can I buy any salt here? I've been
trying to get some all day."</p>

<p>"Little father, where can we get any sugar? Even if
it's only half a pound or a quarter of a pound."</p>

<p>You go into a baker's shop and ask:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>"Have you any white bread?"</p>

<p>The shopman looks at you in wonder.</p>

<p>"We bake no white. Only black, and even that's all
taken for the fugitives."</p>

<p>"The fugitives will eat us up," says Roslavl in terror.</p>

<p>But the wave of fugitives comes on and on, and a
stench is given forth from it. Here the great river stops,
and its waters turn round and round, like a whirlpool.
Roslavl is overwhelmed; the tide rises above its head.</p>

<p>The reason?&mdash;the railway. Hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of thousands of people will remember with
horror the desolation of Roslavl. Here is enacted a
dreadful scene: "The completion of the process"&mdash;the
fugitives giving up their horses. First they were as
"gipsies," but now they have turned into a Khitrof market.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Numbers of the fugitives, the great majority of
them, having exhausted their last strength and reached
the railway.</p>

<p>Have the last thing to do as peasants. They sell
their horses. And thence go onward&mdash;in the train.
Waiting in an open-air camp in Roslavl for a week or so,
until they are given places. And with what desperation
do they cling to the possession of their horses.</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF THE PEASANT&mdash;AND THREE
MOTHERLESS CHILDREN</p>

<p>Here I made the acquaintance of a fugitive&mdash;a bitter
man. His wife died two weeks before the final ruin and
he has three children, two very young, and a baby. He
had owned some land and was a farmer. He had paid
12,000 rubles for it. The payment had been spread over
seven years and all had been paid. He had only just
begun to make a living. And now "this had happened."
He had managed to bring away all his cattle. And four
horses. He had gone a long way.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p>But in Minsk province, where a continuous marsh
extends for tens and tens of versts, an order had come
to clear the high-road, and the cattle had been driven
on to the marsh.</p>

<p>"My little son," said he, "who had gone on in front
with the cattle, ran back to meet me at a turn of the road,
crying, 'Daddy, Daddy, the cattle are all drowned in the
marsh.' I ran to him. The herd of cattle were twisting
and writhing in the bog. Bellowing. And among them
I saw mine."</p>

<p>He spoke sadly but calmly about the death of his
wife, about his land that had "cost so much money."</p>

<p>"But I'd rather have been blinded than see such a
sight. A second ruin. All my property perishing in the
quagmire, and I stand on the road and become a beggar.
Three horses died on the way. One remained. A little
shaggy horse, ten years old, but active."</p>

<p>In Roslavl he found a kind man who permitted him
to live in his <i>banya</i>, bath-house. A black <i>banya</i>. But
that was a palace!</p>

<p>"Day and night I never cease to pray to God for the
kind man who saved my children," says he.</p>

<p>He has found a footing at Roslavl and will remain
there&mdash;drives a cab.</p>

<p>"Two rubles a day shall I earn, think I. One and a
half will feed the horse, and the fifty kopecks which
remain must suffice for us four."</p>

<p>"Not a large budget. And what if you were to sell
the horse and go farther?"</p>

<p>He looked at me straight in the eyes with terror.</p>

<p>"Master!" said he, "I have a horse, and so all the
same I remain a man! A human being! But without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
a horse, what sort of a being should I be? What should
I be?"</p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF THE PROCESSION&mdash;AND THE
COFFINS</p>

<p>On all sides you hear:</p>

<p>"Well, at least we have a horse! So we can still count
ourselves human beings! Still peasants!"</p>

<p>And if the money be all spent, and the peasant cease to
be a peasant. What then? The last thing that connects
him with the past, the last thing that binds him to life.</p>

<p>Along the main street of Roslavl from earliest morning
till the darkness of night without interruption, without
ceasing, go two processions, one one way, the other
the other. On one side of the road come an endless series
of grey carts, one after another endlessly&mdash;and pass away
towards that stretch of the road where yesterday we
saw innumerable camp bonfires. On the other side coming
from that place come refugees on horseback, some
astride, some sitting sideways, on little worn-out horses.
They go to the bazaar. Betwixt the two processions is
the long empty alley of the middle of the street.</p>

<p>On both sides there is silence as if funeral processions
going in opposite directions were meeting one another.
Not even looking at one another, in fact, as if they did
not remark one another.</p>

<p>To the town:</p>

<p>&mdash;To seek salt?</p>

<p>To know:</p>

<p>&mdash;What further orders have been given? Whither
should they go now?</p>

<p>No, no, they are carrying coffins through&mdash;mostly children's.
A peasant is carrying a coffin on his shoulder.
Silently after him and without weeping strides his peasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
wife. Clinging to her skirts also silently and without
weeping come frozen barefooted children.</p>

<p>Look, here comes a large coffin. From the hardly shut
lid hang new and bright coloured cottons. It is a girl
that has died. Four girls are carrying the coffin. They
will bury her in the right way, with the ritual. The
little procession went past, simple, beautiful, melancholy.
No one stopped to look round, to turn the head. No
one meeting the procession crossed himself, nor drew
off his hat, nor gave any attention. As if the people had
ceased to see with their eyes.</p>

<p>And there stretches, stretches, along the footways,
along the margin of the road, without respite, without
interval, without interruption, the two processions ever
coming towards one another and passing.</p>

<p>Grey carts, carts, carts. Horses, horses, horses, fugitives
wandering like shadows, horses, children's coffins,
and again horses, horses, horses. The head turns giddy
looking at the endless movement. It becomes difficult to
breathe because of that which passes before the eyes.</p>

<p>In this little town through which comes such an ocean
of people, it is as quiet as if it were all one great funeral.
I had hardly come into the market-place before the crowd
swirled round me with quick movements and feverish
eyes. Whence had they come to Roslavl? Whence had
so many come? There were all dialects. Great Russian,
Russian and Little Russian accent, with Polish
accent.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF THE PEASANT'S HORSE
MARKET</p>

<p>"<i>Panitch!</i> Do you want horses? You can buy them
very reasonably. Ah, so reasonably! A horse that cost
a hundred rubles, you can buy for twenty-five. Do
you wish to buy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait for me, wait for me. I'll take you to the
horses."</p>

<p>"Mr. Squire, Mr. Squire, here are horses. Farm
horses! And cheap! Cheap! I'll bring them to you."</p>

<p>There's no getting through the horses in the market&mdash;no
possibility of penetrating through. There stands one
great solid crowd. Quick people even slip about under
the horses. What the prices are you may judge from
separate exclamations.</p>

<p>"If there's such a bargain anywhere else on God's
earth I'd like to hear of it!" says a fugitive, turning over
and turning over again the dirty notes which he has
received.</p>

<p>"Don't get rid of them here. Better sell their skins in
Kalutsk."</p>

<p>"Take the twelve rubles now. Take them now. To-morrow
you'll be glad to sell at ten."</p>

<p>"By to-morrow she'll drop down dead if you go on!"</p>

<p>"What! Fifteen rubles not good money? Did you
say that? You?"</p>

<p>"Ten rubles as they stand! From hand to hand!"
says a tall, dark peasant with a long beard, standing beside
a cart to which are tied six horses, all skin and
bone.</p>

<p>He says in a contemptuous tone:</p>

<p>"You see the horses. A red note for each. Altogether.
Take them. It will mean money. Without
money there's no doing anything."</p>

<p>I say to a fugitive:</p>

<p>"Don't you know that in Muchin yard, beyond the
town, they're buying for the Government. There you
would get a fairer price."</p>

<p>The fugitive does not succeed in answering for himself.
Once more the crowd of people with quick movements
and feverish eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Government? There, you'll never get a turn!
It's necessary to stand three days. He's got to hurry
for the train. See what a lot of people are coming in.
He will be late, and have to wait a month in the open.
The autumn rains will start. And cold. All his children
will freeze. From Bobruisk another five hundred thousand
are coming. Who are you, Mister? Are you someone
from the Government or a Relief Committee?"</p>

<p>"Our little children are just freezing to death," says
another fugitive.</p>

<p>And at this market where horses and people are
crushed in one compact mass where from the heat of
bodies and the smell of horses it is difficult to breathe, if
any one is cheerful, it is only the purchaser.</p>

<p>The fugitives have not much to say for themselves,
and that in a low voice&mdash;as if stunned. They sell their
horses and stand as if in perplexity. They go away&mdash;horseless,
peasants no longer, wordless. In appearance
so calm and indifferent: as if nothing had happened.
No expression of the grief, of the deadly melancholy
which is in the soul.</p>


<p>V&mdash;STORY OF THE HOMELESS PEASANT
WOMEN</p>

<p>A silent land. In the same street as the market-place,
by the Petrograd Hotel, from dawn until late evening,
the crowd is like stone. There's no getting through.
The hotel is occupied by the Committee&mdash;of "Northern-Help."
Here it is arranged for the fugitives where each
has to go.</p>

<p>I attempt to pass through the crowd and get as far
as the gateway. Farther is impossible. The stench is
such that the head simply goes round. May God give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
strength to the Relief delegates working in this stench&mdash;to
remain healthy!</p>

<p>"We've been waiting for days!"&mdash;complain the fugitives,&mdash;"and
standing without a bite of food from
morning."</p>

<p>"What's a day! You stand a day and at the end of it
go away. To-morrow you come again and have had
nothing to eat."</p>

<p>I cast a glance at the Town Hall, where is a crowd of
peasant women. In a corner is a table. With the
notice:</p>

<p>"Employment Bureau."</p>

<p>A stout lady sitting there says to a peasant woman
standing with a child in her arms:</p>

<p>"With us, my dear, the conditions of employment for
servants are usually ..."</p>

<p>Tiny Roslavl. How is it possible to find employment
here for tens of thousands of people! The peasant
women stand in the waiting rooms. They stand patiently,
they stand all day. And having obtained nothing
whatever, go away.</p>

<p>In the street you are stopped by people, saying:</p>

<p>"Are you not in need of workmen in your village?"</p>

<p>"Are you not hiring people?"</p>

<p>And all in such melancholy, hopeless, gentle voices. I
drive back to the place where last night I saw a horde of
nomads&mdash;an actual horde. From the high bank of the
Oster, on that side from which the forest has been
cleared, you see for versts and versts a cloud of bluish,
half-transparent smoke. That's the evening camping-ground.</p>

<p>I walk farther and farther into the forest over the
soft wilted grass. Everywhere are glades, everywhere
people, huts of pine-branches, and from all sides is heard
the sound of axes. How many thousands of people are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
there here! People tell you various enormous numbers....
How many drops of water are there in the river?</p>

<p>What a terrible smoke in the forest! Because of the
smoke the eyes of all are red and painful.</p>

<p>"It is damp at night, the smoke settles down, and
there's no getting out of the wood," says a small farmer
to me, "but it's warm in the smoke. Just like sitting in
a dark <i>izba</i>. Hot, even. We warm the forest. That's
what it's come to for us."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's just the smoke that saves us," says his
neighbour, also a farmer&mdash;"everyone is coughing all
around, some are spitting blood, but in the smoke every
microbe perishes."</p>


<p>VI&mdash;STORY OF THE PRIESTS&mdash;AND REFUGEES</p>

<p>Going farther into the forest I come upon a crowd.
A priest is explaining to them how and where to go
that their horses may be properly inspected and priced,
how to go to Muchin yard, sell their horses, and receive
the money; how to go to the railway station and wait
their turn for a seat in the train, how much will be given
to each man for food.</p>

<p>"And I will drive ahead and meet you at such and
such a station." That's so many versts away. This is a
priest from the province of Holm, and he is explaining
to his flock. Many of the priests of Holm province accompany
their refugees. And the help which they give
is colossal. They get some sort of understanding of the
situation for themselves and explain everything to their
people.</p>

<p>It is asked: "Where are the numberless local officials,
the people looking after the village in time of peace,
where are they now in the time of terror and calamity,
where have they betaken themselves&mdash;where, saving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
themselves, do they receive their former official salary?
How they have abandoned this illiterate people who do
not even understand the Russian language well, in such
a moment."</p>

<p>They looked after them all the time like children, and
then, in the difficult moment, abandon the children to
the will of Fate! Had they come with their own refugees,
had even the least important of them come, there
would have been someone to whom to turn for information,
to find out things. But abandoned, left entirely to
themselves, the fugitives grope about, and feel their way
like people with bandaged eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I made acquaintance with a priest. He spoke bitterly.
There was desperation in his voice.</p>

<p>"We try to preserve ourselves together. But we are
assigned to places! Assigned! One part of the flock to
Riazan, another to Kazan, a third to Orenburg!"</p>

<p>Here in the wood are fugitives at the last limit of their
strength, making a decision: To deprive themselves of the
last thing&mdash;to sell their horses. They sell them in the
market-place, in Muchin yard, to "Northern-Help," to the
Government, <i>fkaznu</i>, as they say. Then they are already
not muzhiks; they wander over from this camp to
the camp near the railway station. And whilst they are
encamped in the wood they go backwards and forwards
between the relief points of "Northern-Help" and the
"Municipal Alliance."</p>

<p>On the great highway&mdash;a promenade&mdash;as one of the
numerous gendarmes keeping order put it. Not only is
it difficult to drive through, but difficult to walk through.
The people flock first one way, then the other, with downcast
visage, to the forest, from the forest, from one
side of the highway to the other side of the highway.
At the bonfires they warm their red and chilblained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
hands. Horses pass through the crowd. With triangular
brandings on their hind legs.</p>

<p>Many horses wander about lost. They come to the
high-road, to the people, to the other horses. They wander
about quietly, somehow helplessly, looking around
them with their wise, sad eyes. As if they were seeking
their own people. Horses at the last gasp of their
strength. But no one pays any attention to them.
Neither do the horses pay attention. They stumble upon
people.</p>

<p>In the peasant huts occupied as relief points bread is
taken in at the back door, cut up there, and handed out
from a little window in the front. So from morning to
night bread flows in an uninterrupted stream. Sentries
keep the order of those who are waiting for bread. In
front of the bread windows range endless ranks of fugitives.
Thousands and thousands of people. One person
moves an inch, another person moves an inch, and from
the midst is heard wails.</p>

<p>"You're suffocating me! Oh, suffocating!"</p>

<p>People fall unconscious. Here indeed only the stronger
can stand the strain. The hungry crush the hungry in
order that they may squeeze into a better place in the
line and receive their bit of bread sooner. The women,
the children, with wide staring eyes, with deathly pale
faces. Quietly and silently the fierce and cruel struggle
goes on. All around the people swarm like flies.</p>

<p>A man in a uniform has only to appear, or even a
gentleman in civil attire, and the fugitives swarm about
him.</p>

<p>"Your high nobility! Show us your official mercy!"</p>

<p>Where have I heard this melancholy, hopeless tone,
these very words of humiliation?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"What is it you want?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Give us a certificate!"</p>

<p>Food is only given out to those who have certificates&mdash;according
to the number of souls in the family. Such
certificates ought to have been obtained from the village
authorities at the point from which they started.</p>

<p>"They did not give us them! We had not time to get
them."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Lost!"</p>

<p>&mdash;"We shall die of hunger."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Your high nobility!"</p>

<p>They come for everything, they come to make complaints.</p>

<p>"Your high nobility! Permit me to explain. The
<i>starosta</i> advised me to wait for the Germans and not go
away. I did not agree. He got angry and refused to
give me a certificate. Decide for yourself! Show God's
mercy, and give me one now."</p>


<p>VII&mdash;STORY OF THE WANDERING MULTITUDES&mdash;AND
THEIR PRAYERS</p>

<p>Down below, under the cliff, is an immense marshy
meadow, and there, what a wild, what a strange picture....
At that point I thought of the late V. V.
Verestchagin. Only he with his gray tones could have
painted the gray horror of this life, only he could have
painted the dreadful picture in all its horror.</p>

<p>For several acres the whole meadow was covered with
abandoned and broken carts. The iron parts had been
unloosed and taken away, wheels lay separately, tilts separately.
How many were there there? Tens of thousands.
The whole plain was gray with carts, with wheels,
with shafts and single shafts. Having sold their horses
for cash, the fugitives abandoned their carts here, only
taking with them the iron parts they could unfasten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Among this gray wilderness of ruin fugitives were wandering.
These people who preserved their horses and
could still go on&mdash;in their own carts. They sought here
any bits of harness or shafts or wheels that could serve
them better than their own. From various separate parts
they put together whole carts. Some of the branded
horses had come here. Seeking perhaps, by scent or by
instinct, the carts to which they had once been harnessed.
They wandered and stumbled like shadows,
hardly keeping their feet. They fell. There lies one.
He breathes heavily, suddenly quivers tremulously. In
his round, glassy eyes there is suffering. He tries to
raise his head from the ground. He has not strength to
hold it up, and lets it fall again. Then suddenly he begins
to wail, just like a man. A little farther off lies
a horse already stiff, and its long, long, lean legs stretch
out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The crowd does not melt away but increases. Here it
is cold, here there is no forest. And the fugitives press
together closely, family to family. Only warming themselves
in the smoke of their bonfires. There are bonfires
day and night. Wandering women go from house to
house in the neighbourhood. They stop outside the doors,
crying:</p>

<p>"Give, for Christ's sake, give us wood."</p>

<p>And, the heart anguished, they give.</p>

<p>&mdash;More still is stolen!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Irritated by fear for themselves, frightened at these
"unheard-of people," the little towns and hamlets and
the "all-understanding" villages ... one can only express
astonishment at the celerity with which man
adapts himself to circumstances. Where and when have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
these peasants of yesterday learnt so quickly to build dens
and dwelling-places from any sort of rubbish? It's as
if they were born nomads. It simply makes one wonder.
Out of what was all this put together? How does
it hold? Some slates stolen from one place, a paling
broken somewhere else, an armful of hay, rags brought in
by the children&mdash;and behold, a dwelling-place.</p>

<p>"And, O Lord, how to thank Thee that there is no
longer any rain!"</p>

<p>&mdash;They freeze, get ill, watch their children die, and
wait. It's not possible to breathe. All around is human
filth. In certain stinking horrible ponds, the peasant
women with feet blue from the cold, are washing clothes.
And these ponds also are tainted with filth....</p>

<p>And when I come here in the morning, whilst the
ground all around is covered with hoar-frost and the
half-expired bonfires glimmer beside the marsh on which
the camp is set, the spectacle is dreadful. How reckon
up the sufferings? It's no use even thinking of going
across the station platform. For passage there is only
the merest margin above the rails where one might go
along as on a tight-rope, and sideways. The whole platform
is occupied by the fortunate ones. By those who
have gone through all the trials of the way of affliction,
lost their horses, frozen in open camping-grounds for
weeks whilst they waited; by the people who have at last
obtained:</p>

<p>&mdash;Their turn.</p>

<p>And they will travel, no one knows where, no one
knows to what end. On immense bundles, on top of
mountains of household furniture, lie people, lie or sit,
and you can see that no force could prevail on them to
abandon their positions. When the bell rings, indicating
the arrival of a goods train, wild scenes are enacted.</p>

<p>In the cattle-trucks it will at once become warm, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of the many people, and the fugitives rush to take
the train by storm, crushing one another as they push
forward. And they lug along their bundles.</p>

<p>And how much of the strangest, most unnecessary
rubbish do they pull along with them into the trucks, and
heap up in the places which might otherwise be occupied
by extra people! Rubbish for us&mdash;but the last possessions
for them. That is all that remains.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I return to the town. In endless series, meeting one
another and passing on, go the two processions up and
down the street. They come, they come, they come,
without respite, without interruption, the gray carts.
They are all like one. One like another. And on the
other side of the road come the fugitives on horseback,
to sell their horses. And in this whirlpool of the river
of human grief, little and dreadful Roslavl has choked
and drowned.</p>

<p>Such was the coming of the fugitives into Great Russia.</p>

<p>(The Russian narrator tells many tragic stories of
"Meeting the Fugitives;" "Along the Kief Road;" "The
Forests of Mogilef," and many other vivid sketches of
Russian suffering.)</p>

<h2>THE ADVENTURES OF AN AMERICAN
ATTACHÉ</h2>

<div class="center"><i>A Despatch Bearer in the Diplomatic Service</i><br />
<br />
<i>Told by Eric Fisher Wood, Attaché at the American
Embassy in Paris</i>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>This young American tells of his experience in the Diplomatic
Service in Europe during the Great War. Ambassador Herrick
placed him in charge of the interned Germans, Austrians and
Hungarians in France. He was sent to the front four times
where he saw parts of the battles of the Marne and the Aisne
and the struggle for Calais. His most interesting adventures,
however, was as a despatch bearer between the American Embassies
of practically all the European countries. He tells how
he carried secret documents between Ambassador Herrick,
Ambassador Gerard, Ambassador Page, Ambassador Penfield.
This gave him unusual diplomatic opportunities for seeing and
hearing things of extraordinary interest and significance. These
are related in his book: "The Note Book of an Attaché" (<i>The
Century Company</i>: Copyright 1915) which gives sidelights on
some of the most stupendous events of the last one hundred
years.</p></blockquote>

I&mdash;A STORY OF THE STRANDED AMERICANS
IN PARIS</p>

<p>When the war-storm suddenly loomed over Europe
at the end of July, 1914, I was quietly studying architecture
in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts at Paris. When
Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on July 24th,
the atmosphere of the city became so surcharged with
excitement that to persist in study was difficult. Within
a week I myself had been swept into the vortex of rushing
events, from which I did not emerge until seven months
later....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Paris, Tuesday, August 4th.</i> When I arrived to-day
the <i>Chancellerie</i> presented an astounding sight. Around
the outer door were huddled a compact crowd of Germans,
men and women; they pressed about the entrance;
they glanced furtively over their shoulders and their
blue eyes were filled with dumb apprehension. Inside
the <i>Chancellerie</i> was chaos. Hundreds of Americans and
Germans crowded together seeking audience and counsel.
German women sank down in corners of the halls or on
the stairs, weeping for joy to have found a haven of
refuge. Scores of Sovereign American Citizens stood in
the busiest spots and protested with American vehemence
against fate and chance. Each S.A.C. was remonstrating
about a separate grievance. Most of them reiterated
from time to time their sovereignty, and announced to
no one in particular that it was their right to see "their
Ambassador" in person. They demanded information!
They needed money! They wished to know what to do
with letters of credit! What was "the government" going
to do about sending them home? Was Paris safe?
Would there be immediate attacks by Zeppelins? Could
they deposit their jewels in the Embassy vaults? Were
passports necessary? WHY were passports necessary?
They asked the same questions over and over, and never
listened to the answers....</p>


<p>II&mdash;IN THE AMERICAN LEGATION AT BERNE</p>

<p><i>Berne, Saturday, November 28th.</i> Donait and I left
Paris at nine last evening for Lyons, Culoz, and Geneva
with dispatches for Berlin. For many reasons we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
particularly anxious to see Germany and Austria in war
time, and look forward keenly to the experience which
we face.</p>

<p>We arrived in Geneva at noon. We were very tired,
for our train and compartment were overcrowded and
we had to sit up all night. The responsibility of the
sack of official papers which we carried, and on which
one of us had constantly to keep his mind, hand, and eyes,
was an additional element of fatigue.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our legation in Berne has always been the most isolated,
humdrum spot on earth. People stationed here
nearly died of ennui; nothing ever happened, until all
Europe suddenly was plunged into the conflagration of
war, and then Berne became, of necessity, the clearing
house for the continent for dispatches, mail, telegrams,
money, prisoners, and refugees. Every telegram which
the American Embassy in Paris sends to the Embassies
in Germany, Austria, or Italy is directed: "American
Legation, Berne. Repeat to Gerard"&mdash;or Penfield or
Page, as the case may be....</p>

<p>Donait and I were sent by Minister Stovall to make a
verbal report on the situation of the Germans in France
to Baron Romberg, the German Minister to Switzerland.
I was much impressed in this my first touch with a
German official. He is rather small, slim of body, but
keen of mind, with excellent repose and control. Like
all German diplomats, he speaks faultless English. A
startling evidence of the efficiency of the German Information
Bureau was furnished by the fact that he already
knew to the minutest details nearly as much about my
work in Paris in caring for German subjects as did I
myself.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, December 1st.</i> We reached the Swiss-German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
frontier at noon to-day. We descended from the
train at Basle and drove three miles to the frontier. Here
there were two barriers straight across the road, the
nearer one guarded by numerous Swiss soldiers; the farther,
some twenty yards behind, by soldiers wearing the
spiked helmet. Before we were allowed to pass the first
barrier our papers and luggage were minutely examined
by Swiss military and customs officers. We then walked
across the twenty yards to the second, or German, barrier,
where we were conducted into a little guard-house.
Here some dozen soldiers were sleeping or playing cards
on cots in the background along the walls. An efficient
sergeant examined our papers and then allowed us to pass
the second barrier into Germany, showing marked respect
for the Herr Lieutenant and the Herr Attaché....</p>

<p>I was momentarily embarrassed and self-conscious
when first I found myself rubbing shoulders with gentlemen
in spiked helmets. During the past four months
I had seen them only as prisoners or dead men, and their
only greetings had been by way of their shells and
bombs....</p>


<p>III&mdash;AWAKENED BY THE SECRET SERVICE
MEN</p>

<p><i>Mannheim, Wednesday, December 2d.</i> At half-past
seven this morning I was awakened from a sound sleep
by a pounding at my door. I climbed sleepily out of bed
and, in pajamas, opened the door to two extremely polite
and suave Secret Service men who, nevertheless, examined
my papers with the greatest thoroughness and as
carefully cross-questioned me as to my race, color, and
previous condition. They asked to see my dispatches,
whose seals they studied in order to be certain that I was
really carrying some sort of official messages. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
listened with close attention to my story, they asked me
out of a clear sky where Donait was and why he had
left me. They capped the climax by reminding me that
at Leopoldshöhe I had told the sergeant we were bound
for Berlin, which was exactly what I had told him, not
having considered the brief stop at Mannheim of sufficient
importance to be mentioned. When they had received
a satisfactory explanation of the discrepancy (the
conversation having staggered along in German, of which
my knowledge is limited) they thanked me politely and
withdrew....</p>


<p>IV&mdash;AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN BERLIN</p>

<p><i>Berlin, Thursday, December 3d.</i> Donait and I had a
whole compartment to ourselves last night, which shows
how normally German railroads are running. We arrived
in Berlin at eight o'clock this morning, bathed,
dressed, and had breakfast, at eleven o'clock presented
ourselves at the American Embassy and delivered our
precious dispatch pouch to Mr. Grew, the First Secretary....</p>

<p>The Emperor is in popular estimation not much lower
than God Almighty, and the two seem inextricably mingled
in the public mind. The world-wide amusement
created by "<i>Me und Gott</i>," or by the Emperor's firm
conviction that he and he alone is worthy of divine aid
and approval, is an amusement not shared by any Germans.
If you say to them, "the Emperor seems to think
the German people are the one race chosen of God and
that He works only for them and their advancement,"
the Germans will promptly and emphatically reply: "Why,
of course; all our past history proves that." The God
they appeal to, however, is the God of Battles of the Old
Testament and of the ancient Hebrews, who slew His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
enemies, destroyed nations, and annihilated races, who
was cruel and vindictive.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Berlin, Friday, December 4th.</i> In Berlin, restaurants,
cafés, theaters, and concerts are going at full blast. Donait,
Iselin, and I, who have for months been working
like dogs in Paris, which is as dull as a country village
and where cafés close at eight and restaurants at nine
and no places of amusement are open other than a few
poor cinemas, are thoroughly enjoying the contrast....</p>

<p>People who one day read the announcement of the
death of a son, a father, or a brother, are seen the next
day in the streets or cafés going about quietly, expressing
or betraying neither sorrow nor regret. The loved one
has died "<i>für Gott, für König, und für Vaterland</i>."
That is glory enough, and neither the Emperor nor the
people feel that it is appropriate to mourn for one who
has died for his country....</p>

<p><i>Berlin, Sunday, December 6th.</i> About the atrocities
in Belgium there is, apparently, no question, but considering
the way the Germans controlled themselves in France,
some explanation of their brutality farther north in
Belgian Flanders is necessary. The Germans say that
the cruelties were not all on one side; that the Belgians
practised sniping, impeded the German army, and mutilated
German wounded. The only one of these charges
that seems to have been proved is that of sniping, but
even if other cruelties were committed it must be remembered
that the moral status of the Belgians was entirely
different from that of the Germans. The Belgians were
aroused to blind fury by the disregard of their neutrality
rights and the unwarranted invasion of their peaceful
country....</p>

<p>Recently I had a long conversation with a German
statesman of ambassadorial rank, who spoke with intense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
feeling of the plight of the thousands of German
subjects, men, women, and children, who had been caught
in France at the opening of the war and interned in
detention camps. He said: "It is ridiculous for the
French to suspect any of these people of being spies, for
German spies are not weak or unprotected, but strong,
picked men and women, highly trained to make technical
observations."</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, December 8th.</i> I went to the American Embassy
this morning to obtain the necessary paper for my
departure to-morrow for Vienna. Mr. Grew called me
into his private office and said that Ambassador Gerard
was particularly anxious that I should go to London
instead as he had dispatches of the utmost importance
to send and would feel indebted to me if I could take
them. He warned me that the undertaking would not
be pleasant or altogether safe. I promptly accepted the
mission,&mdash;indeed such requests are, in the Army, the
Navy, and the Diplomatic Service, made only to be accepted.
I am to leave Berlin Thursday morning at 8:59
and go through Germany and Holland to Flushing, where
I shall take a boat across the North Sea to Folkestone and
thence to our Embassy in London.</p>


<p>V&mdash;ON THE WAY TO HOLLAND&mdash;SHADOWED
BY DETECTIVES</p>

<p><i>Thursday, December 10th.</i> Soon after the train left
Berlin this morning I judged that I was being shadowed.
When it pulled out of the station there were four people,
including myself, in the six-place compartment, the
two middle seats being vacant, one on my left as I sat
next the window and the other diagonally facing me.
Soon after the train was well started two men came in
and occupied these seats. This in itself was suspicious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
since people do not seek seats while a train is in motion.
Both moreover had the air of being detectives. I, by
this time, know the type well, for I have been constantly
shadowed ever since my arrival in Germany and am perfectly
certain that my rooms have several times been
searched while I was absent. I simply continued to behave
with the greatest possible circumspection, the two
detectives meanwhile staring at me constantly with fixed
intensity.</p>

<p>It was a bit unpleasant because I did not certainly
know the nature of the dispatches I carried, but realized
that they were extremely important. They were in a
small leather mail pouch, padlocked and sealed, which
I had set on the floor between my feet and knees. Everything
went quietly for some two hours. I could not look
out of the window in towns and yards because I might
have seen troop-trains, factories, etc., and that would
have been "indiscreet." The part of Germany from Berlin
to Holland is utterly flat and uninteresting, so that
there was no pleasure in looking at the countryside between
stations. I pretended to doze, or read three German
weeklies which I had bought. One of these finally
precipitated matters. It was the <i>Fliegende Blätter</i>, a
comic paper of about the class of <i>Life</i> or <i>Punch</i>. There
was in it a joke in German argot which had been too
much for my scant knowledge of the language and the
courier who had escorted me from the Embassy had by
the merest hazard translated it for me. In my desperate
efforts to amuse myself I was looking through this sheet
again and encountering this joke thought, "If I don't
write down the English I shall forget it." Whereupon
I took out a pencil and wrote the translation interlinearly.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards one of the detectives got up, went
out into the corridor, and came back with three conductors
who, in Germany, of course, are military officials. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
three civilians who had shared the compartment left us
as if they had been rehearsed. One of the detectives
then suddenly burst into a perfect berserker rage, getting
quite purple in the face, and snatching up the <i>Fliegende
Blätter</i> proceeded carefully to turn over the pages
again and again, holding each page against the light. It
was altogether melodramatically ridiculous. Taking the
paper from me in this way, although inoffensive, was
perhaps within his rights since it concerned me only in
a personal and not in an official way, and so I sat quite
calmly in my seat and, biding my time, made no move of
any kind. I paid no attention to the conductors, judging
the detective to be the kingpin and the conductors merely
dragged in as a matter of routine. None of them could
read English and they chose to regard the interlineation
(one line of about ten words) as extraordinarily suspicious.</p>

<p>The detective asked me for my passports and did so
without going through the customary formality of showing
his police card. I demanded as a matter of routine
that he do this and began to draw out of my pocket the
large envelope in which I keep all my documents in order
to take out my Eagle-stamped German courier's paper.
Without complying with my request he grabbed for this
envelope, while at the same moment someone jerked at
the bag which was between my knees. All this was an
affair totally different from that of the <i>Fliegende Blätter</i>.
I had thoroughly thought out what I would do in an
emergency if German officials should attempt to take
my pouch from me, and had decided that I should make
enough of a resistance so that there should be no possibility
of disputing the fact that physical force had been
used and an assault committed. This would "let me out,"
since a dispatch-bearer cannot be expected successfully
to defend himself against the whole German army. Incidentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
I might add that interference in any way with
the dispatch-bearer of a neutral country is a very heinous
international and diplomatic sin. I therefore jerked my
envelope of papers rudely out of the detective's hand
and gave him a vigorous shove, resisting an almost overwhelming
temptation to hit him with all my might on his
fat, unprotected jaw. I had half risen to my feet, meanwhile
keeping a grip on the dispatch bag with my knees,
and at the same time I vigorously swung my hips and
freed myself from the man below. The detective struck
the opposite wall of the compartment and bounced off
toward the doorway, where he and the conductors stood
jabbering and waving their arms and ever getting more
and more purple in the face.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;OUTWITTING THE PRUSSIAN SPIES</p>

<p>Finally the detective showed his police card, and I
then extended to them my Eagle-stamped courier passport,
following it with my Embassy credential and my
certificate of identity or personal passport. These three
made a complete case and I refused to show anything
more, insisting that my status had been adequately established.
The officials continued to jabber and argue,
having been continuously impolite during the entire episode,
a mode of behavior which was a notable divergence
from my previous experiences with agents of the Imperial
Secret Service. The chief detective, whose name
was Werther, continued to hang around, trying to talk
with me, evidently determined to get further information
about my plans.</p>

<p>I do not pretend to judge whether all this was mere
accidental clumsiness and rudeness on the part of stupid
detectives or if it was something very much deeper,
prompted by someone higher up. One is, however, inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to doubt inefficiency in the Prussian Secret Service
and there may have been reasons why German authorities
would count it of great importance to know the contents
of my pouch....</p>

<p>I was followed constantly thereafter, as previously, the
men being cleverly changed at every opportunity. My
every step was dogged. At Wesel a detective sat at
the same table in the station restaurant while I ate dinner.
Such being the case I was, to say the least, a bit
annoyed.</p>

<p>At Essen during a fifteen-minute wait for a change of
trains, I withdrew to one end of the platform after having
rechecked the two big mail-sacks. I was standing alone,
with a detective, as usual, off in the background, when
a man who looked a typical raw-boned Englishman drew
near and hung around, staring at me. I looked him up
and down and then turned my back thinking, "Another
detective!" It was impossible to believe that an Englishman
could be, of all places, in Essen. He finally approached
me, saying in English of a most perfect and
pronounced British accent, "Are you an American?" I
replied, "Yes, are you a police officer? If so, please show
me your card." He replied, "No, I am in a delicate position.
I am trying to go to England this evening. I
have American papers. You must see me through. I
am &mdash;&mdash;." I cut him short by saying that I regretted,
etc., and deliberately walked away. From that time on
this man dogged me everywhere, trying to pass through
gates with me and to get into the same compartments,
even following me to the same hotels and restaurants,
and trying to make anything he could out of my presence.
I never lost sight of him for long until we finally
set foot in England, where he did finally arrive, in spite
of some very close shaves. I last saw him giving me
a very ugly look as I landed at Folkestone. Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
his nationality, he certainly was a spy in the German
service.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;SAFE ARRIVAL AT EMBASSY IN LONDON</p>

<p><i>London, Saturday, December 12th.</i> We had an exciting
trip across the North Sea, taking zigzag courses
to avoid mine-fields and sighting numerous destroyers
and one sunken ship. We successfully avoided either
hitting a mine or running into a torpedo. The boat was
packed down with Belgian and French refugees. One
Luxembourger had been a whole month getting to Flushing
from his home in Belgium. I was much relieved
when I arrived at Victoria Station with my pouch and
found a clerk from the Embassy waiting for me, and
still more relieved when we had deposited all the bags
safely at their destination.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Sunday, December 13th.</i> Imagine the face of any British
telegraph operator if I were to hand him a cable saying:
"I am leaving again for Berlin and Vienna," which
is exactly what I am to do. I return immediately with
dispatches from England to our Embassies in Germany
and Austria. My plans are subject to modification by
official orders, but I shall probably remain in Berlin only
one day and then go to Vienna and Budapest. The bag
I am to take to Berlin contains not only official dispatches,
but a large sum of money....</p>

<p><i>On the North Sea, December 16th.</i> It has been a wonderful
stormy day to-day; as an officer said: "a typical
North Sea winter day"&mdash;a leaden sky, roaring wind,
smothers of rain, great black-green waves all flecked
and blotched in white, big sea birds and little gulls dipping
down the wave valleys and soaring up the wave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
mountains, and the ship taking the most foolish and
impossible angles....</p>

<p>Two hours out a British destroyer came dashing up
in our wake, making two feet to our one. She was a
most picturesque sight, long, low, and speedy, painted
black; her towering knife-prow thrust out in front and
the long, low hull strung out behind. She "brought us
to" with a shot across the bows, and as we wallowed in
the trough of the sea, she went by to starboard fairly
shaving our side. The officer on her bridge, over which
great waves of spray and water broke at every moment,
"looked us over" and then bellowed orders to our captain
through a megaphone....</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;EXPERIENCES AT THE EMBASSY IN
VIENNA</p>

<p><i>Vienna, Saturday, December 19th.</i> I remained in Berlin
only one day and started this morning for Vienna with
dispatches, arriving late in the evening after an uneventful
fourteen-hour journey.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, December 20th.</i> I presented myself at the
American Embassy this morning and delivered my dispatches....</p>

<p><i>Monday, December 21st.</i> I had a walk and talk with
Ambassador Penfield this morning; took luncheon with
Mr. Grant-Smith and went afterward to the Embassy.
Later in the afternoon I went with Count Colloredo von
Mansfeld to the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Office and
then called on the Countess Potatka to whom I had
brought letters of introduction.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, December 22d.</i> After luncheon to-day Mr.
Grant-Smith presented me to Wilhelm Prince zu Stollberg
Wering Rode, Conseiller of the German Embassy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Vienna, who made an appointment with me for Thursday.</p>

<p>I am meeting many officials, American, German, and
Austrian, but at present I cannot, without indiscretion,
state just what they discuss....</p>

<p><i>Thursday, December 24th.</i> I made a verbal report
to Prince zu Stollberg this morning on the situation of
German subjects in France. After luncheon I had a
most interesting talk with Mr. Nelson O'Shaughnessy,
of Mexican fame, who is Conseiller at the Embassy.
Later I went for a most delightful automobile ride with
Ambassador Penfield....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Count Berchtold, whom I have seen on several occasions,
is a wiry man of medium height, always grave, intent
and all-observing under a mask of stolidity. He
never "talks" and seldom speaks. When he does he is
terse and speaks out of one corner of his mouth as if
reluctant to let the words escape. He is, however, noted
for the most unfailing and perfect manners. It is said
he can hear perfectly every separate conversation that
may be carried on in any room where he happens to be
present, and not only hears what is spoken but catches
every little motion or hint of important matters. Such
is the man whose hand struck the match that lit the
long-prepared conflagration in which the total military
casualties alone already far exceed five million.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>IX&mdash;IN A CASTLE AT BUDAPEST</p>

<p><i>Budapest, Tuesday, December 29th.</i> I left Vienna at
nine o'clock this morning and reached Budapest at two.
I had tea with Mrs. Gerard, who is in Budapest visiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
her sister, Countess Sigray. I called at the home of
Count Albert Apponyi to leave my card and letters of
introduction. I dined with Mrs. Gerard and the Count
and Countess Sigray.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Austrian Emperor is a little man, slightly stooped,
rather shriveled-up and possessed of a pair of keen,
shrewd eyes. He is an able follower of the Emperor
Ferdinand who once replied to the statement that a certain
one of his subjects was a patriot by saying: "I don't
care if he's patriotic for the country, but is he patriotic
for me?" Franz Josef is cold, pitiless, and does not
hesitate to ruin in a moment his most faithful servitor
if he is at any time guilty of failure, or commits a blunder.
Even when a minister or general is forced to carry
out an order in spite of strong protests, he has relentlessly
broken him if any catastrophe has resulted. A notable
case is that of the general who commanded the Austrian
armies in the battle of Sadowa.</p>

<p>At the request of the Countess X. I had written to her
mother, the Countess W., before leaving Vienna, and
found her answer awaiting me at the Consul's office when
I arrived in Budapest. I learn that she also communicated
with Count Berchtold, the Prime Minister of the
Empire, with Count Szecsen, ex-Ambassador to France,
and with the Hungarian Premier, so that in case I missed
her letters (she sent me one to Vienna and one to Budapest)
these gentlemen would see to it that I went to visit
her, as she wished to thank me personally for what I
had been able to do for her daughter, and also to hear
direct news of her grandchildren.</p>

<p>I left Budapest early this afternoon and arrived after
dark at Békéscsaba, which is about half-way to Belgrade.
I was met by a major-domo who appropriated my luggage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and led me to a private car on a private railroad
belonging to the Countess. We started immediately and
ran in about twenty minutes to the gate of the estate
where she usually resides. Here I was carefully transferred
into a waiting carriage and was tenderly tucked
into numerous fur rugs by two or three strong men. The
two splendid horses turned through the gates for a ten-minute
drive across a beautiful park to the castle&mdash;and
such a castle! It is equal in size and charm to some of
the famous French châteaux along the Loire which I
studied last spring.</p>

<p>I was carefully unpacked again under a splendid porte-cochère
and ushered by numerous flunkies into the presence
of the Countess. She received me in a tremendous
room with a lofty ceiling, and in a preliminary talk of
an hour she took off the first keen edge of her appetite
for news.</p>

<p>My bedroom is perfectly huge and has two ante-rooms&mdash;for
the personal servants whom I do not possess. We
dined at eight, there being at the table, besides the Countess,
a daughter and her companion, a Frenchwoman.
During dinner the Countess mentioned that the war necessitated
frequent readjustments in the management of
her estates; that the military authorities had recently
taken another five hundred of her men for service in
the army. She asked me if I enjoyed hunting and, upon
receiving an affirmative answer, said that she would send
me for an hour or two with the pheasants in the morning.
She warned me that the shooting would be poor
because no care had been taken of the preserves since
her sons departed for the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>


<p>X&mdash;WITH THE HUNGARIAN NOBLEMAN</p>

<p><i>Saturday, January 9th.</i> Yesterday on my arrival in
Budapest I found awaiting me an invitation from Count
Albert Apponyi to visit him at his castle at Eberhard, near
Pozsony. I left Budapest at eight, reached Pozsony
about eleven, and drove to Eberhard, where I was received
by the Count.</p>

<p>I was extremely impressed on meeting Count Apponyi.
I had anticipated something unusual, but he was quite
beyond my expectations. He is about six feet three inches
tall, has a splendidly erect carriage, and is a most impressively
handsome man. He has a broad, well-shaped
forehead sloping back steeply, splendid blue-gray eyes,
the biggest, thinnest nose in the world, enormous nostrils,
a strong, sensitive mouth, and a grayish, square-cut
beard. The "grand old man of Hungary" looked up to
his title.</p>

<p>He has been a member of the Hungarian Parliament
for forty-two years and has several times held ministerial
portfolios....</p>

<p>He has twice been in America. He has several times
visited ex-President Roosevelt at the White House and
at Sagamore Hill, and the Colonel has been a guest here
at Eberhard....</p>

<p>At luncheon there were as guests the Count and Countess
Karolyi Hunyadi and two of their sons, and the
Countess Herberstein, whose husband is a general in the
army.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, January 10th.</i> I had the honor of a very interesting
walk and talk with Count Apponyi this morning.
Among other things he said: "I sometimes let my
younger daughter (aged 12) play with the children of
the peasants on the place. It gives her an understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of life, and besides, there is no one of her own age and
rank in this part of the country." This for a Hungarian
nobleman is an extremely democratic remark.</p>

<p>(And so this American Attaché continues to write in
his notebook the impressions which he received on his
official journeys through the war-ridden countries, which
were so soon to become the enemies of his own country.
His diary is one of the most interesting records of the
war.)</p>

<h2>'NEATH VERDUN&mdash;BEHIND THE
CROWN PRINCE'S ARMY</h2>

<div class="center"><i>By Lieutenant Maurice Genevoix&mdash;Translated by
H. Grahame Richards</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>This extraordinary narrative by a young Lieutenant in the
French Army gives the most vivid impression that has been
recorded of the Great War. The author was a student at the
Ecole Normale, Paris, at the outbreak of the War. He received
his baptism of fire in August, 1914&mdash;and what a baptism it was!
It has been truly said by critics that his narrative is one which
will be read and reread and handed on to posterity. He lays
bare the soul of the War. Under his magic touch, we stand at
Verdun; we see the army at "The Crossing of the Meuse";
we stay with them through "The Days of the Marne"; we
march with them "Behind the Crown Prince's Army"; we fight
with them "In the Woods." We here reprint portions of his
narrative by permission of his American publishers, <i>Frederick A.
Stokes Company</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
I&mdash;STORY OF THE LIEUTENANT AT VERDUN</p>

<p>Half-past one in the morning! Kit bags on the
ground, rifles piled, lines in sections of four, at the edge
of a little wood of birch trees struggling for life on a
stony soil. The night is cold. I place a listening post
well forward and return and seat myself near my men.
The stillness is palpitating; the passage of time interminably
long-drawn. The dawn begins to lighten the sky.
I look around me and see the pale and tired faces of my
men.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<p>Four o'clock. A dozen rifle shots to the right cause me
to leap to my feet just as I am making myself comfortable.
Out of a small neighboring wood a dozen Uhlans
are flying at a gallop&mdash;they must have passed the night
in the covert.</p>

<p>The day breaks clear and fresh. My Nubécourt bed-fellow
produces his inexhaustible flask, and we sip a
drop of brandy which possesses no bouquet at all and
seems like raw alcohol. The Captain joins us at last and
explains the situation in a few words:</p>

<p>"A German army corps," he says, "is marching towards
the southeast, having for flank-guard a brigade which
follows the valley of the Aire. The &mdash;th Corps is going
to engage the said German corps, while it remains for us
to deal with the flanking brigade."</p>

<p>For the first time I am going to experience war in all
its reality!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Clac! Clac! Two bullets have struck immediately
to my left. The noise at once surprises and slightly
amazes me; these bullets seem less dangerous when they
sing and whistle. Clac! Clac! Stones, pieces of dried
earth, spurts of dust fly into the air; we have been seen
and they have got the range of us. Forward! I am
leading, seeking a ditch, a slope, a fold in the earth
wherein to shelter my men after the first rush&mdash;even the
hedge of a field, or anything which will render them less
visible to the Boches will do. A movement of my right
arm shortens the line by half. I hear the tramp of feet,
the rustle of the stubble lying in our course. And while
we are running forward the detachment in support fires
rapidly but steadily. Then when I raise my cap, that
detachment in its turn charges at the double, whilst all
around me my men's rifles come into play and speak unceasingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>A strangled cry to the left. I have scarcely time to see
the man sprawl flat on his back, his two legs still moving
as though to carry him forward. A second, and all his
body stiffens and then relaxes and the man is no more
than an inert thing, dead flesh which to-morrow the sun
will commence to decompose.</p>

<p>Forward! To remain still would cost us more dearly
now than the most furious assault. Forward! The men
are falling rapidly, stopped dead in full course, some
crashing prone without a word, others halting and staring
stupidly, while feeling with their hand for their wound.
And they say: "I have got it," or, "Mine has arrived!"
Often it is no more than a single expressive word. Almost
all of them, even those whose wounds are slight,
turn pale at the shock.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Oh!..." The cry escaped a dozen of us at once.
A high explosive burst clean among the Saint Maixenter's
platoon. And he, I saw it distinctly with my own
eyes, received the shell full in his body. His cap vanished
into space, a part of his coat, an arm. And there
he is lying on the earth a shapeless mass, white and red
pulp, a body stripped well-nigh naked, shattered. His
men, finding themselves leaderless, give way and scatter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We march through an inferno of smoke, from time to
time obtaining a glimpse, through momentary clearings,
of the village and the river running beneath the trees.
But there is no truce to the shells which follow us in
hundreds.</p>

<p>I recollect passing one of my sergeants being carried
by two of the men on crossed rifles; he pointed out to
me speechlessly, his torn and blood-stained shirt and his
side terribly lacerated by an explosion. I could see the
raw edges of the flesh....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>I march onwards and onwards exhausted and stumbling.
I take a long gulp of the water that remains in my
flask. Since yesterday evening I have eaten nothing.</p>

<p>When we reach the edge of the stream, the men halt
and throw themselves down and commence to lap the
muddied waters like dogs.</p>

<p>It must be seven o'clock now; the sun is sinking into
a bed of virgin gold. The sky above us is a pale and
transparent emerald. The earth darkens, colors vanish.
It is quite dark by the time we leave Sommaisne. We
become mere shadows trailing along the road.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not a wink of sleep. The noise of the shells hurtling
through the air is constantly in my ears, while the acrid
and suffocating fumes of explosives haunt my nostrils.
Scarcely yet is it midnight before I receive orders to
depart. I emerge from the trusses of wheat and rye
among which I had ensconced myself. Bits of stalk have
slipped down my collar and up my sleeves, and tickle me
all over. The night is so dark that we stumble over the
stones and irregularities of the ground. We pass very
close to some 120's drawn up behind us; I hear the voices
of the artillerymen, but only with difficulty can I distinguish
the heavy sleeping guns.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hallo! The German guns are speaking early this
morning! Before us shrapnel is bursting noisily and
spitefully. Over the plain they have thrown a barrage.
Nevertheless we have to go through it. Our first section
detaches itself; in a line, long-drawn and thin, it moves
across the fields towards a small wood which the captain
has indicated as the objective. Rifles crackle away
to the left. Bullets sing and throw up the dust about
the marching section. Then shrapnel bursts right over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the men. The undulating line becomes still, taking cover
behind a ridge of earth shaped like a gigantic caterpillar.</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF THE CHARGING GERMANS</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Hurrah! Vorwärts!"</p>

<p>How many thousands of soldiers are surging down
upon us then? The moist earth quivers beneath the
tramp of their heavy feet. Most surely must we be
smashed to pieces, trampled down, broken. For there
are not more than sixty of us all told, and how may sixty
men extended in single file hope to resist the tremendous
pressure of these ranks upon ranks of men rushing down
upon us like a herd of maddened buffaloes?</p>

<p>"Rapid fire! <i>Nom de Dieu!</i> Fire!"</p>

<p>The crackling of the rifles rends the air; spurts of
flame shatter the darkness. The rifles of my platoon have
spoken simultaneously!</p>

<p>And now there is a gap in the very heart of the charging
mass. I hear shrill screams of agony as of beasts
mortally stricken. The dark figures divide to flow right
and left, just as if, before the trench, and extending its
whole length, a tempest had raged and laid men to the
earth, as the breath of the gale bends down the growing
wheat.</p>

<p>Some of the men about me say:</p>

<p>"Look, Lieutenant! See, they are lying down!"</p>

<p>"No, my friend! It is not so. They have fallen
down!"</p>

<p>And ... (Censored.)</p>

<p>Once more I repeat:</p>

<p>"Fire! Fire! Let them have it! Put it into them!
Fire!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Hurrah! Vorwärts!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>I am surrounded by Boches; it seems impossible that
I can escape, separated as I am from all my men. Nevertheless
I grasp my revolver in my hand and pray only
I may be permitted to give a good account of myself.</p>

<p>Suddenly I am sprawling face downwards, nose to the
earth, having stumbled over something hard and metallic.
Lying in the mud is the body of a dead German whose
helmet has rolled a little away from him. Instantly an
idea seizes me. I pick up the helmet and place it on my
own head, passing the strap beneath my chin to secure
it.</p>

<p>There follows a mad flight for the safety the chasseurs
will afford. Without hesitating a second, I rush by
groups of Boches who are wandering about doubtfully,
their original plans having been rather upset by our fusillade.
As I pass them I cry:</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Vorwärts!"</p>

<p>Like them, too, I keep repeating the word to which
they seem to attach great importance, which is:</p>

<p>"Heiligtum!"</p>

<p>The rain stings my face: the mud adheres to my soles
until only with difficulty can I raise boots which have
become enormously big and heavy. Twice I fall on my
hands and knees, only to rise again and instantly resume
my flight, notwithstanding my aching legs. Singing and
whistling bullets pass over me into the darkness beyond.</p>

<p>Out of the blackness at my feet a man rises and the
words on his lips are French.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Letty?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lieutenant; I've got one in the thigh."</p>

<p>"That's all right, old man; we'll get there yet!"</p>

<p>Already there are no more harsh-voiced brawlers
around us. Manifestly they must reform before continuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the assault. So I throw away the helmet and replace
my cap of which I have taken good care.</p>

<p>Before reaching the chasseurs I overtake four Boches,
in each of whom, either in the back or in the head, I put
a revolver bullet. Each one drops in his tracks with a
long, strangled cry.</p>

<p>(Censored.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Skirting the base of a steep slope, I pass through a fire
zone where the bullets in hundreds, whining and shrilling,
tear up the soil all about me. Then I encounter a
group of men, standing at the foot of a tree. There is
a dying officer in the center, supported against the tree-hole.
A glimpse I have of a dark blue tunic wide opened,
of a shirt stained with bright blood. The wounded man's
head sags heavily down to his shoulder, and in the whitened,
tortured face, moist from fearful agony, I recognize
my own major.</p>

<p>But I must not stay!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I question a lieutenant who is marking the fall of the
shells through his glasses, shaking from head to foot
the while from excitement.</p>

<p>"Things going well? Eh?"</p>

<p>He turns towards me. The joy which fills him is
plainly legible in his face. He laughs exuberantly:</p>

<p>"I should say they are going well. The Germans are
giving way&mdash;deserting their positions like rats a sinking
ship."</p>

<p>He laughs once more. "Listen to our 75's! They are
making them dance like madmen! That is the way to
carry on, what? They are being kicked in the sterns
now, the swine!"</p>

<p>A staff captain on foot is watching the delighted gunnners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
He laughs also and repeats several times in a loud
voice: "Good! Very good!"</p>


<p>III&mdash;STORIES TOLD AFTER THE BATTLE</p>

<p>Heavily and dreamlessly I sleep, and awake to find
myself in precisely the same attitude as that in which I
flung myself down the preceding night. The straw wraps
me in grateful warmth, rather moist, perhaps, because
the water in my saturated clothes has evaporated during
the night....</p>

<p>We find that in the night the torrent has well-nigh
filled the trenches with liquid mud. Some sappers, however,
come to our assistance, and, thanks to them, we are
able to shelter ourselves from the worst of the downpour.</p>

<p>The men work easily, flinging jests one to the other.
The incidents of the night attack are revived and acquire
a totally new force by reason of the simple words
in which they are related.</p>

<p>"I was all right at the beginning," says Martigny, one
of my men. "But all at once, while I was still firing,
down toppled a Boche right on top of me, without so
much as a "by your leave!" I was on my knees and he
lay across my calves. It's not easy to fire in such a position
as that! Little by little the weight forced my knees
down into the mud; the water rose almost up to my
hands: how was I to refill my magazine? I could not see
the animal, but you can take my word for it, he was
heavy."</p>

<p>And a second:</p>

<p>"A good job for me that I was once fencing-sergeant
in the regulars! Otherwise I should not be here now.
Not even time to fix my bayonet before I found one of
the ugly pigs on top of me with his skewer. I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to myself: 'What's all this about? But you are going to
find you can joke once too often, my Boche!' And there
we were all in and at it. I parried a thrust with the
stock of my rifle, but what sort of defence could I put
up, seeing that my weapon was much shorter than his?
Only he didn't manage to get his bayonet into me!...
There wasn't even a cartridge! I tell you that Boche
kept me jumping from side to side until I felt like dying
from weariness. You know what a job it is to parry,
when you can no longer feel your own fingers? Still
jumping, I said to myself: 'What in the name of glory
are those asses right and left fooling about? Are they
going to stand by and see me knocked out?' Oh! but
they were there all right, and it was Gillet to the right
who put a bullet into him while he was pausing to take
a breath. Then I stuck on my bayonet and filled my
magazine. There were others still coming up, you understand!"</p>

<p>"Sons of pigs, these Boches!" rasps a miner from the
North. "And what mugs they are too, <i>Mon Dieu</i>! When
I saw them swarming over towards me, 'Martin,' said I
to myself, 'you're done for this time!' And then:
'Hurrah!' they're off! Bang, bang, bang! And I knew
no more."</p>

<p>"Martin, you are babbling," grunts a huge Champenois,
who is smoking his pipe and listening with eyes atwinkle.
"Hammer away at the earth, seeing that is what you
were born for; but don't mix yourself up in conversations,
because you can't talk."</p>

<p>He spits on his hands, rubs them against each other,
and taking up his pick starts digging again with long,
steady, powerful strokes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the evening we go into the village. I stroll slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
towards the barn where my section is billeted. In the
square, a group of noisy soldiers is gathered before a
house which has nothing in particular to distinguish it
from its neighbours. With much pushing and stretching
of necks they are contriving to scan a big placard stuck
on the wall....</p>

<p>The first word that encounters my eyes, however, gives
me a violent shock. I can see nothing else but that word,
which instantly seizes upon my excited imagination and
seems to presage things marvellous, superhuman, incredible.
The word is:</p>

<p>"Victory!"</p>

<p>It sings in my ears, that word. It echoes through all
the streets, it bursts on me like a triumphant fanfare.</p>

<p>"Victory!" Thrills pass through me, enthusiasm seizes
upon me and stirs me so violently as to make me feel
almost sick. I feel that I am too small to contain the
emotion to which the sacred word gives rise.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>The retreat of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd German Armies
is becoming pronounced before our left and centre. In
its turn, the enemy's 4th Army is beginning to fall back
to the north of Vitry and Sermaize.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>So that is it, then! We have been progressing everywhere.
We have grappled with them, badly torn them,
wounded them! Oh! that it may run and run, that
German blood, until every particle of strength shall have
streamed out of them!...</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORIES OF THE GRAVES&mdash;AND CROSSES</p>

<p><i>Marats-la-Grande.</i> We do not pass through the village.
Some mounted batteries are passing and scaling the
sloping fields towards the road. The riders are shouting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and whipping their horses, already straining at the
collar. Poor beasts! So thin that one can count their
ribs, sides chafed raw by the harness, heads hanging,
they strain and strain until their laboured breathing is
audible, while their large bleared eyes speak eloquently
of their sufferings.</p>

<p>A grave; two posts have been tied to form a cross!
On the horizontal one a deep notch has been made with
a knife, revealing the white heart of the wood. Someone
has written in pencil the name of the soldier whose
body is lying in the earth, his uniform for his shroud.
The number of his regiment, his company and the date
of his death, the 9th of September, are also inscribed.
Four days! Only four days ago that decomposing something
lying beneath the mound of earth was a man in the
full flood of life, hoping, perhaps, soon to be reunited
to the dear ones waiting for him. Four days!... His
parents would not have heard yet.</p>

<p>More graves. They are not laid out in any particular
order, or even in groups. At irregular intervals, they
line the road we are following, which is no more than a
trampled-down track over fresh grass between trees in
leaf. Everywhere one can see these sad little crosses,
on almost all of which a red cap hangs. Without halting,
the men read aloud the inscriptions. The 8th of
September, the 9th of September, the 10th of September....</p>

<p>And here is one which is not marked with the little
cross of branches. A stake has been simply driven into
the ground, bearing a burnt-in inscription to tell passersby
the name of the dead man; on the newly-turned earth
some white stones have been arranged in the form of a
cross&mdash;they seem to protect him who lies there better and
more intimately.</p>

<p>Hastily-made graves, turned out with small trenching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
tools, how I wish you were much deeper! Your lines
suggest the shape of the body you hide from our eyes.
The rain must have soaked you these last days and
nights! But at least calm and peace are with you. The
enemy is far away, never to return. Guard well, then,
your poor dead, until the day dawns when the old men
and women shall come to demand of you the bodies of
their loved ones!</p>

<p>We march onwards a few minutes longer and reach a
bare plain studded with shell-craters. The sun is sinking,
the rays of its golden light striking obliquely. Mutilated
horses are lying about, their stiff legs crossed or
thrust up towards the sky.</p>


<p>V&mdash;TRAMP! TRAMP! TRAMP! ALONG THE
ROAD OF CORPSES</p>

<p>"Fall in!"</p>

<p>New orders have just arrived and we are to move on
again.</p>

<p>Before leaving, I pick up a fragment of shell over
which I stumbled. It is fifty centimetres long by fifteen
wide, with jagged edges like the teeth of a saw. I contemplate
this terrible thing lying heavy in my hand. To
what kind of a shell, swift and growling, must it have
belonged? This fragment must be one of those which
cleanly sweep away an arm or leg, tear off a head, or
cut a man completely in two. And holding it thus in
my hand, heavy and cold, I remember a poor little cyclist
who was killed close to us in Septsarges Wood&mdash;one leg
taken away at the hip and the lower part of his abdomen
laid open.</p>

<p>Trees and a shimmer of green on a wide road, away to
the north. Night is falling. Suddenly through the grayness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
we find ourselves looking upon some ruins&mdash;we
have reached Erize-la-Petite.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another road skirting the line which links Rembercourt
with Vauxmarie and Beuzée. In the ditches,
hunched up or stretched at full length, are human corpses.
A single corpse is a rare spectacle. As a rule they are
lying huddled together as if seeking to warm each other.
The failing light reveals blue coats and red trousers;
Frenchmen; more Frenchmen, in fact nothing but
Frenchmen! Judge my enthusiasm on finding some
Boches among them! I fall out several times to make
sure that these really are Boches. The foe cannot have
had the time to hide away that lot!</p>

<p>The night becomes black and corpses are no longer
visible. But they are always there, at the bottom of the
ditches, on the slopes at the very edge of the road. We
realize their presence even in the dark. By shielding the
eyes and peering hard, it is possible to see the eerie heaps
which have lost all resemblance to that of which they are
made....</p>

<p>Not a word in the ranks; nothing but the regular
tramp, tramp, before and behind me; occasionally someone
coughs, a little dryly, or a man spits. That is all.
It must be cold, yet my head and hands are burning, and
my will struggles to subdue an uncontrollable inclination
to turn to my right where the cool waters of the Aire,
flowing by the roadside, are betrayed by the stagnant
pools under the trees.</p>

<p>An unexpected halt! The men bump their noses
against the packs of the file in front. Confusion and
much swearing. Then quick commands:</p>

<p>"Quartermasters prepare rations for distribution."</p>

<p>It is the best of all signs. The day's march is ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Come! Head erect and fists clenched! No more of
that weakness that a moment ago assailed me. We must
look unmoved on these poor dead and seek from them
the inspiration of hate. It was the Boche in his flight
who dragged these sorry things to the side of the road,
who arranged this horrid spectacle for our express benefit,
and we must never rest until the brute has drunk our
cup of vengeance to the dregs.</p>

<p>Impotent and childish is the fury that only inspires us
with rage and the passion for vengeance instead of fear,
as our foe hopes and believes.</p>

<p>Besides, every step forward now presents us with eloquent
testimony of the completeness of the defeat they
have suffered&mdash;helmets torn and pierced by our bullets,
crushed and shattered by our shells; rusty bayonets;
broken cartridge-belts, still full. To the left of the road
in the fields are some overturned ammunition wagons
and gun-carriages in pieces, the horses lying dead in a
heap. In the ditch is the carriage of a shattered machine-gun;
one can see the hole made by the shell&mdash;a 75. What
a state the gun on that carriage must have been in! And
the machine-gunners? At the bottom of the hole!
Ammunition belts of coarse white canvas lie coiled in
puddles.</p>

<p>We pick up some boots full of rain-water. I wonder
whether the men from whom we took them walked barefooted
through the mud merely for pleasure? In another
hole we find the men themselves. Further on again
we encounter crosses bearing German inscriptions. Here
then are the Ottos, the Friedrichs, the Karls, and the
Hermans! Each cross bears four, five and even six
names. The Germans were in a hurry; they buried their
men in bunches.</p>

<p>A cross higher than the others attracts and holds our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
attention; it bears no more than three words deeply
carved in big capitals:</p>

<p>ZWEI DEUTSCHES KRIEGER</p>

<p>Is there still another challenge hidden behind this? If
so, it is obscure. For who killed you, you two German
soldiers?</p>


<p>VI&mdash;TALES OF THE NIGHTMARE DAYS</p>

<p>Over the trampled roadway, newspapers, post-cards
and letters flutter. I pick up a photograph on the back
of which a woman has written a few lines:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My Peter, it is a long time since we received any
news from you and we are naturally very anxious. I
think, however, that very shortly you will be able to tell
us of still further victories and that you will return in
glory to Toelz. What a fête you shall have then...."
And then further on: "The little one has grown and is
becoming quite strong. You could never imagine what a
little treasure he is. Do not be too long in returning, or
he will not be able to recognize you."</p></blockquote>

<p>Sad enough, indeed, is it not? Whose, however, is
the fault? Remember our dead of a short while ago;
remember the captain flung almost across the road.
What has he done, of what is he capable, this Peter, this
German whose photograph shows him with lowered face,
cold eyes, heavy-jawed, resting his hand on the back of a
chair on which his wife is seated, smiling but negligible?
Pity at such a moment would shame us. Let us harden
our hearts and keep them hard until the end comes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And so in memory I live again through bad days,
nightmare days&mdash;the <i>réveil</i> in the furious, stinging rain;
the arrival at Louvemont, that indescribable village little
better than a sewer. I had gone over to the quarters of
the adjoining section because before their barn a little
chimney-piece had been erected with some paving stones.
There had been a fire of flaming logs, hissing and spluttering.
We had stripped ourselves to the waist to let the
grateful warmth of the flames play on our chests and
backs and shoulders. Sitting on a bundle of straw we
had found an old, white-bearded soldier, dreaming. I
had gone up to him and said:</p>

<p>"Hallo, M&mdash;&mdash;! So you are better! Beginning to feel
alive once again, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Lieutenant. But it has been a hard pull, a
very hard pull!..."</p>

<p>And he had repeated in a low voice, as though experiencing
again hardships still recent: "Very hard!"</p>

<p>Poor old man! He had gone through the campaign of
'70 as a volunteer, and since those days had lived outside
France. For thirty years, I believe, he acted as a
notary in California, until the very day, in fact, which
had brought this war upon us. Then, when France was
once more attacked and menaced, he had flung everything
aside and had come back to shoulder his rifle. He had
described himself as being robust, smart and well able
to endure any hardships. They had accepted his statement
and sent him up to face the Boches with the first
batch of reinforcements. He had joined up with us in
the woods at the very moment we were setting out for
those nightmarish advance posts; those two succeeding
days were the first of his service. Poor old man!&mdash;and he
was sixty-four years of age!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We had crossed the line from Verdun to Conflans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
marching ankle-deep in wet coal-dust. Before a smoke-blackened
house at the barrier some enormous girasols
thrust forth their yellow and black corollæ, their colours
rendered more brilliant by the recent rain. We passed
some quads of territorials with their tools on their shoulders,
artillerymen from the big fortresses, slow-moving
country wagons laden with forage, tree-trunks and wine
casks. Wooden huts had been erected along the roadside,
each of which had a name inscribed on it, such as: Happy
Villa; The Good Children's Castle; Villa Piccolo, etc.
Verses adorned some of them, not of high poetical attainment,
but something after this fashion:</p>

<div class="poem">
"You never see us weeping here&mdash;<br />
Often you'll see us drinking beer.<br />
War may not be the best of fun,<br />
But we'll stick it till we've smashed the Hun!"<br />
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An interruption. A woman appears, thin and dirty,
pushing before her a little yellow-haired girl, whose eyes
are red-rimmed and tear-stained. The doctor having
been consulted, prescribes for colic.</p>

<p>"And what do I owe you for that, doctor?" asks the
woman.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, madam."</p>

<p>But she draws from beneath her apron a dusty bottle.
"I must 'recompinse' you somehow. There is not very
much in it, but what there is tastes good. It is good:
oh, but indeed it is!"</p>

<p>It is Toul wine, dry, thin and somewhat sharp. A
brawn, turned out on to a plate, gives us an excellent
lunch.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we pass to the observation trench.
We overtake a group of lame men, without weapons,
coats open, almost all of them limping along with a stick.
Among them I recognize a friend of pre-war days. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
shake hands and speak eagerly and with pleasure of
common memories, before approaching the inevitable
regrets. As he belonged to a regiment which was compelled
to give way before the Boches, I asked him how
it had come about. He shrugged his shoulders despondently.</p>

<p>"Masses of infantry; an endless hail of shell; not a gun
to support us ... don't let's talk about it, old man."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The thunder of the 75's almost splits our ears. Occasionally
a German shell flies past us with a shrill whistle
and peppers the trees with a volley of shrapnel. Into
the midst of this tumult we march and take up position.
My section occupies about fifty yards of a trench already
full of corpses.</p>

<p>"Out with your tools," I say to my men, "and dig for
all you are worth."</p>


<p>VII&mdash;THE DEATH WAILS OF THE WOUNDED</p>

<p>Night falls. The cold increases. It is that hour when,
the battle ended, the wounded who have not yet been
brought in, cry aloud in their suffering and distress. And
those calls, those appealings, those moanings, awaken
anguish in all those compelled to listen to them; an anguish
the crueler for the fighters who are chained to
their posts by stern duty yet who long to rush out to
their gasping comrades, to dress their wounds, to speak
words of comfort to them, and to carry them to safety
where fires burn brightly and warm. Yet we must not
do so; we are chained to the spot, our hearts wrung, our
nerves quivering, shivering at the sound of soul-stricken
cries brought to us unceasingly by the night.</p>

<p>"A drink!..."</p>

<p>"Are you going to leave me to die here?..."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stretcher-bearers!..."</p>

<p>"Drink!..."</p>

<p>"Ah!..."</p>

<p>"Stretcher-bearers!..."</p>

<p>I hear some of my men say:</p>

<p>"Where the devil are the stretcher-bearers!"</p>

<p>... (Censored.) ...</p>

<p>"They are like fleas&mdash;you can never find them when
you look for them."</p>

<p>And before us the whole plain wrapped in darkness
seems to shiver from the agony of those undressed
wounds.</p>

<p>Voices soft, weary from having cried so long:</p>

<p>"... (Censored.) ...</p>

<p>....?"</p>

<p>"Mother, oh, mother!"</p>

<p>"Jeanne, little Jeanne.... Oh! say that you hear me,
my Jeanne!"</p>

<p>"I am thirsty.... I am thirsty.... I am thirsty.... I
am thirsty...."</p>

<p>Voices in anguish, panting and gasping:</p>

<p>"I won't die here like a rat!"</p>

<p>"Stretcher-bearers! Stretcher-bearers!... Stretcher-bearers!!!"</p>

<p>"... (Censored.) ...</p>

<p>....?"</p>

<p>"You fellows, finish me off, for God's sake! Ah!..."</p>

<p>A German not more than twenty yards away, cries out
incessantly:</p>

<p>"Kamerad! Franzose! Kamerad! Kamerad!
Franzose!"</p>

<p>And in a lower voice:</p>

<p>"Hilfe! Hilfe!"</p>

<p>His voice wavers and breaks into a wailing as of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
crying child; then his teeth snap fiercely; then he shatters
the night stillness with a beast's cry, like the howling
of a dog baying at the moon.</p>

<p>Terrible beyond the power of words, that night. Every
minute either Porchon or myself were jumping to our
feet. The whole time we were under fire and the cold
was truly cursed.</p>

<p>The nearer we approach the village, the more numerous
become the wounded men returning from the fight.
They come in groups, carefully selecting the shorter grass
to walk over, seeking the shade to avoid the burning sun,
which makes their wounds smart intolerably. There are
a few Germans mingled with our men; one big-built man,
fair, ruddy and with blue eyes, is assisting a little French
infantryman, who limps along jesting and laughing and
displaying all his teeth. With a wicked glance towards
us, he cries aloud to the Boche:</p>

<p>"Is it not true, you pig, that you are a good pig?"</p>

<p>"I understand," exclaims the German gutturally.
"Pig, good pig! I understand!"</p>

<p>And an unctuous laugh spreads all over his greasy
face, happy at this display of camaraderie which promises
so well for him, as vile and loathsome as are all
Boches when at the mercy of a conqueror....</p>

<p>In the clear, cool night, to the accompaniment of many
voices, the sections assemble and line up, and the companies
are reformed. How attenuated, how mutilated
they look!</p>

<p>My poor battalion! To-day's fight has once again cost
us dearly. The 5th, which was so terribly cut up two
weeks ago in the trenches at Vauxmarie, has also suffered
cruelly again.</p>

<p>As for my own men, I know only too well those who
are missing. Lauche, my sergeant, the only one left to
me since Vauxmarie&mdash;it is always Vauxmarie!&mdash;I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
seen him, as Vauthier put it, clawing the grass at the
bottom of the ditch; I knew he was gone already. There
was big Brunet also, and several others struck down at
my side. And when I told the corporals to step forward
and call out the rolls of their squads, voices responded
which were not theirs. In each case a man of the "first
class" or old soldier stepped forward to say:</p>

<p>"Corporal Regnard, wounded."</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p>"Corporal Henry, killed."</p>

<p>"And Morand?"</p>

<p>"Corporal Morand, wounded," said an old soldier.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not one sergeant! Not even a corporal! All those
squads which become after a time a well-beloved family
to those in charge of them, a family not to be parted from
without sorrow and regret&mdash;here they are deprived of
their leaders, to whom they look up constantly, who watch
over them, who sustain them through long and difficult
hours by the mere magic of their presence. I had known
each one of them so well, those I had lost to-day! They
were the men of my choice, men for whom a single word
from me was sufficient, men who had never sought to
shirk their duties, accepting their task whatever it was,
and fulfilling it to the very best of their powers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Through the field behind us men are moving. We can
hear the rustling of the dried leaves they are gathering;
the falling flakes of earth from the roots they pull up;
they have discovered some turnips. We remember then
that so far we have eaten nothing.</p>

<p>It is cold. We shiver. We remain silent.</p>

<p>(The young French Lieutenant continues in his book,
"'Neath Verdun" these tremendous experiences in which
he shows the self-abnegation of the French soldiers. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
comrade, Porchon, was killed at Les Eparges on February
20th, 1915. M. Genevoix himself was wounded&mdash;but
his love for France and his spirit of exaltation lives
on. The last chapter in his book, "The Armies Go to
Earth" is a vision of the reality of these days when the
world is being reconstructed.)</p>

<p>This is the story of the Anzacs. It is told by one of the New
Zealanders who was with them in Egypt. He was present at the
Landing and did his best to uphold the honor of Maoriland in
the long and grim battle of the trenches. Throughout these
adventurous days, he kept a diary which has been published
under title "On the Anzac Trail." This diary tells the tales of a
man in the ranks; it is told without gloss or varnish. A few
anecdotes are here retold by permission of his American publishers,

I&mdash;STORY OF THE NEW ZEALANDER</p>

<p>When the Great War struck Europe I was living with
my people in Ireland. I had served in the South African
campaign, so, of course, I realized that it was up to me
to roll up again and do my bit towards keeping the old
flag flying. It's a queer thing, but let a man once go
on the war-path and it's all the odds to a strap ring he's
off again, full cry, to the sound of the bugle. I reckon
it's in the Britisher's blood; he kind of imbibes it along
with his mother's milk. When all's said and done we are
a fighting breed....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<p>When England took off the gloves to Germany I knew
the Colonies wouldn't hang back long. They breed men
on the fringes of our Empire. Hence I wasn't surprised
when I saw a notice in the papers, calling on all New
Zealanders, or men who had seen service with the Maorilanders
in South Africa, to roll up at the High Commissioner's
office in London, to be trained for service with
the "Down Under" contingents. Well, I had lived for
years in New Zealand, and had fought Boers time and
again side by side with New Zealand troops, so I sent
in my name right away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>... I fancy this "history" of the doings of the Anzacs
is going to be more of a diary than anything else. I kept
a rough note of things as they happened day by day. For
one thing the diary style pins the various events down to
a kind of sequence and insures their being told in the
order in which they happened; for another it saves the
author a deal of labor. This by way of explanation and
apology. Here goes, then&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<p>II&mdash;DANISH SKIPPER AND GREEK CREW&mdash;ON
WAY TO ALEXANDRIA</p>

<p><i>April</i> 17, 1915.&mdash;Sailed from Alexandria in transport
<i>A26</i>, otherwise the S. S. <i>Goslar</i>, a captured German prize.
We had a Danish skipper and a Greek crew&mdash;a poor lot
as seamen go. We were quartered in the forepeak, the
quarters being rough, but on the whole fairly comfortable.
We shared them with a healthy and mightily lively lot of
brown bugs. The tucker wasn't too bad.</p>

<p>The weather was fine and the sea calm all the way to
Lemnos Island. Had a pow-wow with the O.C., who
read out aloud the General's orders, informing us that
we should land under cover of the warships' guns, that
we were to drive the Turks back, secure a footing, and
hold it <i>at all costs</i>. Anticipated heavy losses. When dismissed
went and made our wills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Were met on the 19th by the cruiser <i>Dartmouth</i> and
escorted by her till the evening, when a destroyer took
us in charge and saw us safely into Mudros Harbor.
The <i>Dartmouth</i> informed us by semaphore that transport
<i>B12</i>, steaming one hour ahead of us, had been attacked
by an enemy torpedo boat, three torpedoes being fired at
her, all of which missed. A number of soldiers jumped
overboard, thinking the transport was doomed, and were
drowned. The torpedo boat was engaged by our ships,
driven ashore and destroyed.</p>

<p>We arrived in Mudros Harbor, in Lemnos, on the
night of the 19th. It was just crowded with shipping,
and looked for all the world like a big floating town.
Were informed that there were over 200 transports and
60 warships gathered in the harbor. Had a splendid view
of the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> as she lay quite close to our old
hooker. The anchorage was simply alive with destroyers,
torpedo boats, submarines, etc., both French and English.
The French craft struck me as being a bit mouldy-looking,
not so up-to-date as the British. You could always
tell a French destroyer, she was so crowded up with
all kinds of deck gear, and had a general Back of Beyond
look about her&mdash;like a chap who had stopped washing
and shaving for a longish spell.</p>

<p>During our stay at Lemnos we amused ourselves by
practising boat drill, landing of troops, etc. It was no
joke swarming down a rope ladder loaded up in full
marching order&mdash;and it was just as bad climbing up again.
One of our chaps let go his rifle; the rest contented themselves
with language. No one was drowned.</p>

<p>It was while lying here we had our first solid day and
night's rain, the first really heavy fall since leaving home.
The temperature rapidly dropped in consequence till it
became like early summer in England. Were told that
we should find no firewood where we were going, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
orders issued that each man was to carry a bundle of
kindling wood strapped on top of his pack. We shall
look like a mob of walking Christmas Trees when we get
all on. Living on bully beef and biscuits now; no bread.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 23.&mdash;Had a rather pleasant sail in one of the
ship's boats to-day. Landed on a small island in the
harbor and cut a big supply of green fodder for the
horses we had on board. Found the formation of the
island to be volcanic in character, as all the land round
about these parts seems to be. Not much sign of water,
yet the sole of grass was good, and the color a vivid
green. Plenty of white clover, some of what looked like
English cocksfoot, and a plant that struck me as Italian
rye-grass. Heard the cuckoo and the lark, and noticed
some small green lizards scurrying over the outcropping
rocks. <i>Thought</i> I saw a tarantula spider, but wouldn't
swear to it.</p>

<p>Coming back to ship we found we had to beat against a
head wind. Our craft was lug-rigged, the sail something
like a dirty pocket-handkerchief. She had no use for
beating; there wasn't a beat in her. Tried to ram an outward
bound mine-sweeper which refused to get out of
our way. Mine-sweeper's captain called us names that
may have been true but didn't sound nice. Doused the
sail and rowed back. In the evening we watched the
French and English transports and warships leaving the
harbor. Rumors fill the air&mdash;the latest that we leave for
the Dardenelles to-morrow (24th).</p>

<p><i>April</i> 24.&mdash;Preparations for the big event. Told that
the staff were prepared to lose 80 per cent of the forces
to effect a landing; also, that the fleet could see us ashore
but that <i>it couldn't take us off again</i>; once ashore we'd
got to look after ourselves. The fellows stroked their
chins and looked thoughtful for a spell; I reckon they
were thinking of the pie that mother used to make&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of their latest girls. We were also told that as like as
not all the wells on Gallipoli would be poisoned, and that
we should have to do on our water-bottles for three days.
Three days on about a pint and a half! And biscuits
ditto! We began to cotton on to it that it wasn't a picnic
or mothers' meeting we were out to take a hand in. Were
served out with a 2-oz. tin of tobacco between four men,
and three packets each of cigarettes. Handed in our
blankets and waterproof sheets, so will be going ashore
as we stand. Very stiff fight expected, as it is fairly
sure that the Turks will do all that is in them to beat us
back. Wonder how many of the boys will go under?</p>

<p><i>Later.</i>&mdash;Under way. All lights out and general air of
suppressed excitement on all hands. Some of the chaps
making a book on the event, and laying odds on the
chances of the takers getting through the slather-up unharmed.
Others tossing up to see if certain of their
mates will finish up in heaven or hell! No one the least
downhearted; all determined to at least give the enemy
the time of his life when they come to grips. They are
certainly as tough a crowd as ever got into uniform.</p>

<p>Landing expected to take place just at daybreak or
slightly earlier. Creeping along like a "mob of thieves
in the night," as one of the chaps put it. Distance from
Lemnos about 45 miles, I hear, so will be there in whips
of time. Funny thing to think that one's folks will be
lying in bed sound asleep at the moment we go into the
enemy, and never dreaming of what their men will be
taking on. Just as well, too, come to think of it.
Weather A1. Sea calm; nothing to complain of in that
line, anyway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF "HELL LET LOOSE" AT ANZAC</p>

<p><i>April</i> 28.&mdash;First chance of scribbling anything for
three days. Been through hell&mdash;just that. War! It
wasn't war; it was just cold-blooded butchery. How the
position has been held beats me. But held it has been&mdash;and
it's going to be held&mdash;at a cost! I wonder what the
price of crêpe will rise to out in Australia and New
Zealand! Here goes for a shy at describing our amusement
of the past three days.</p>

<p>It was dark when we left the transports off Gaba Tepe
and crept in towards the denser blackness that represented
the shore. The night&mdash;or early morning, rather&mdash;was
still; everything seemed in our favor; not a sound
welled out seaward, not a light twinkled in the murk
ahead. Could it be that we had taken the Turks by
surprise? Or were they simply lying low and playing
a waiting game? Soon we were to know.</p>

<p>On&mdash;on crept the boats loaded to the gunwales with
the citizen soldiers from the Dominions. Every jaw
was set hard as agate, every eye was fixed on the forbidding-looking
heights now taking form dimly as the east
reddened and the sky became shot with lengthening spears
of greenish-yellow. Minutes passed&mdash;minutes that
seemed as hours&mdash;while ever shoreward crawled the fleet
of boats, and even plainer and gloomier loomed the
frowning cliffs that dominated the Bay of Anzac. Back
of the flotilla, away to seaward, lay the British warships,
their gray hulls floating ghostlike in the first of the dawn&mdash;like
couchant lions scenting blood. A sense of protection,
modified to some extent by the stretch of intervening
water and the ghostliness of their outlines, emanated
from those cruisers and battleships squatting like
watch-dogs on the chain, alert and eager. Our gaze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
wandered ever and anon from the forbidding shore ahead
to where those uncouth gray hulls broke the sea-line.
Would they never give tongue!</p>

<p>... We were close to the land. The <i>wouff!</i> of a
gentle surf breaking on a sloping shingle beach, followed
by the <i>soughing</i> of the undertow, came plainly to our
straining ears. Back of the crescent-shaped strand, now
dimly outlined in a flatted monotint of leaden gray, rose
the darker, scrub-clothed slope, its breast seamed and
gashed by <i>dongas</i> and water-courses, that stretched to the
foot of the sheer bluff whose summit cut the sky-line 400
feet above our heads. As the minutes passed the scene
changed. Sand and shingle took form and color in the
rapidly growing half-tones. The blackness of the slope
beyond merged into a velvet green. The serrated crest
of the ridge grew roseate as the first of the sun-rays
stretched forth athwart the fields of Troy and touched it
with gold-tipped fingers. A new-born day begotten of
early summer had sprung from the womb of an Eastern
night&mdash;a day fraught with much of suffering, much of
mutilation and death, but surely a day that shall live in
the history of the British Empire so long as that Empire
stands....</p>

<p>Was it the surprise we all hoped for, after all?&mdash;the
surprise that seemed beyond the bounds of possibility.
Were there <i>any</i> Turks there waiting to oppose us at all?
And if so, where were they hidden? In trenches cut on
the beach? In the scrub? Behind the crest of the cliff?
God! were they never going to show themselves&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Crash! Bang! Z-z-z-z-z-ip!</i> It was hell let loose&mdash;hell
with the bottom out! The whole beach belched flame
and spat bullets. The scrub behind burst forth into a
sheet of fire. Maxims&mdash;maxims everywhere! The place
seemed alive with them. It was as if we had received
a blizzard of lead in our faces. The physical shock was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
almost more than flesh and blood could bear. For a moment
it seemed as if the whole flotilla was doomed&mdash;a
moment in which whole boatloads of brave men were
absolutely cut to pieces and mangled out of all recognition&mdash;in
which boats were blown from the water, smashed
into matchwood and riddled from stem to stern by the
high explosive and shrapnel fire that came over the crest
of the cliff hot on the heels of the rifle and machine-gun
fire. Just a moment! Then the men from the bush, the
plains, and the cities of Australasia showed the stuff they
were made of. In dashed the boats&mdash;in anyhow, no
matter how, so long as they touched Turkish soil&mdash;some
bow on, some stern on, some broadside. All higgledy-piggledy,
a confused mass like a huge dismembered raft
tossed on a sea that hissed and spouted as its surface
was torn by the never-ceasing rain of lead and iron.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;HEROIC CHARGE OF THE
AUSTRALASIANS</p>

<p>Over the sides of the boats dived and rolled those splendid
infantrymen, their bayonets already fixed. They
knew what to do; no need to give them orders. No
time to form&mdash;no time to think. The cold steel&mdash;nothing
but the steel! Off fell their packs; down dropped their
bayonet points, and with a wild yell that rose even above
the awful battle roar that made day hideous they hurled
themselves straight as their rifles at the unseen enemy.
In sixes and sevens, in tens and twenties, in platoons, in
half-companies&mdash;just as they tumbled out of the boats&mdash;those
great-hearted fellows dashed up the beach and into
that sickening inferno. They didn't fire a shot; they
didn't waste a single second. They just flung their heavy
packs from their shoulders, bent their heads to the storm,
and with every inch of pace at their command they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
charged the Turkish trenches, some fifty yards distant.
Charge! I never saw a charge like it. It was a wild,
breakneck rush, regardless of losses. Nothing short of
killing every man of that magnificent soldiery could have
stopped their onslaught. The machine-guns and rifles
took their toll&mdash;but they utterly failed to beat down that
desperate assault delivered by those iron-nerved men&mdash;those
men who openly boasted that they feared "neither
God, man, nor devil." In a moment they were into the
enemy's front line of trench, machine-guns were captured,
and the Turks got a taste of the bayonet that will
never be forgotten by those who escaped. And they were
few. Just a minute of hacking, slashing, and stabbing&mdash;one
minute of sickening yet exhilarating butchery in
which no quarter was given; when to <i>kill!</i> and <i>kill!</i> was
joy unspeakable&mdash;and those long, lean, brown-faced men
with the square jaws and fierce eyes were up again, their
bayonets, smoking, and charging the second line of
trenches with the same dare-devil recklessness. What
power on earth could stop such men? Not the Turks,
anyway. With imploring cries of "<i>Allah!&mdash;Allah!</i>" they
abandoned their trenches and scurried up through the
scrub, the panting Colonials straining every nerve to
overtake them.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand the Australasian character.
He will joke even in the midst of danger, nay, death.
He is, as a rule, a "hard doer;" and even his best friends
must admit that he is often a hard, and fairly original
swearer. Nothing is safe from him when looking for
a butt; very little is sacred, I fear, and his humor takes
a queer bent sometimes: which accounted for the behavior
of the landing force on this occasion, dear reader&mdash;that
and the desire to inflict all the Arabic he knew
(picked up in Egypt) on the fleeing Turk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Imshi! Yalla!</i>" yelled the now laughing Colonials,
as they followed hard on the heels of the enemy.</p>

<p>"<i>Allah! Allah!</i>" continued the Turks, and they put
on an extra spurt.</p>

<p>"<i>Allah</i> be d&mdash;&mdash;d! Clean 'em boots! Eggs is cook!
Three for a l'arf! <i>Imshi</i>, you all-fired illegitimates!"</p>

<p>Such, with the addition of ear-splitting coo-ees, wild
bush oaths, and a running fire of blasphemy and unearthly
cat-calls were the battle cries of the men from
Down Under as they drove the enemy out of his trenches
and up the hill, through the scrub, over <i>dongas</i> and gullies,
right to the base of the sheer cliff itself, up which
finally, all mixed together and sliding, crawling, and
clinging like monkeys, scrambled pursuer and pursued in
one loosely strung mob of panting, war-drunken men. It
was the personification of grandeur: it was the apotheosis
of the ludicrous. In a word it was the old reckless,
dare-devil spirit of their ancestors&mdash;the men who carved
out the British Empire&mdash;re-born in those virile youths
and young men from that bigger and fresher and brighter
Britain overseas.</p>

<p>Meantime the guns of the fleet were pouring in a terrific
fire, their shells screaming overhead and bursting
well beyond the ridge. It was difficult at first to see what
execution they were doing, and at this stage of the fight I
don't think many of the enemy were bagged. As our
chaps advanced farther inland the shells from the ships
began to pitch amongst them, so their elevation was
raised and their fire concentrated on the Turkish communications
and on the dominating hills that lay on our
flanks. They also tried hard to locate and silence the
enemy's big guns, but they were so well concealed that it
was almost impossible to silence them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>


<p>V&mdash;"ALLAH! ALLAH!" AN OPEN BATTLE
WITH THE TURKS</p>

<p>Once on top of the ridge our fellows paused for a
minute or two to get their breath, then, as full of fight
as ever, they doubled into the scrub and pursued the
retreating Turks with unabated ardour. It was now an
open battle, and except for the fact that the Anzacs were
exposed to a heavy shrapnel fire, Jack was as good as
his master. In threes and fours at a time the shells
burst over and swept through the lines of advancing men,
taking their toll all the time. The Turks took full advantage
of the plentiful cover; they knew the country and
we didn't. Now and then one caught a glimpse of a fleeing
figure or two; that was all. We had no field artillery
to cover our advance, and the consequence was we suffered
heavily, our guns not coming into action till the
evening, and then only one or two had been landed.
Add to this the natural difficulties of a broken and rugged
country which we had never seen before, and the reader
will have some conception of the task that faced the
Dominion troops. It was next to impossible to keep in
touch with each other, let alone preserve something approaching
an unbroken line. Thus the fight resolved
itself largely into one of units. Here and there isolated
bodies of infantry pushed far ahead, then lying down
they held on grimly until the main force came up and
eased the pressure.</p>

<p>One or two lots got caught in the beds of deep gullies,
were opened on by concealed enfilade fire from machine-guns
and rifles, and died to a man. But they died fighting.
One party at least fought its way almost to the
Narrows, and then disappeared: not a single man returned.
The rest pushed on and on, trusting to the reserves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
coming up and enabling them to hold the captured
ground&mdash;those reserves that came in driblets only. The
fact was that the men could not be thrown ashore quickly
enough to reinforce in the strength required. Where
battalions landed there should have been brigades; where
brigades, divisions. It was just sheer bad luck. No
blame attached to the fleet&mdash;every man worked like a
Trojan, worked on without paying the slightest attention
to the hail of projectiles falling around. They were
white right through, those boys from the warships, from
the plucky little middies and the jolly "Jacks" right up
to the senior officers. I pity the chap who ever says a
word against them if any of the Anzacs happen to be
within coo-ee of him! Come to think it over, I don't
see that blame could be fixed on any one. The country
was just made for defensive purposes; it would have
required division after division to have been thrown in
on each other's heels in order to reduce it, or to seize
the ground to the Narrows and hang on. We simply
hadn't the men. And the natural difficulties in the way
of getting up such reinforcements as we had, not to
speak of supplies, ammunition, etc., were nigh insurmountable.
There were no tracks, much less roads; the
guns that <i>were</i> landed that first evening had to be pulled
by hand through the standing scrub; the landing parties
on the beach were open to continuous shell fire, not to
mention snipers&mdash;altogether I don't think there was ever
such a daring or hazardous enterprise attempted in the
world's history.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;STORY OF THE BAYONET CHARGE
AGAINST THE MOHAMMEDANS</p>

<p>And now strong Turkish reinforcements appeared on
the scene. Battalion after battalion of fresh troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
joined the enemy firing line. It stiffened up: we failed
to break it. Our men were falling fast; half our strength
seemed to be down, killed or wounded, while the remainder
were beginning to feel the effects of their tremendous
gruelling in the fierce heat of a sub-tropic sun.
Still on came the masses of Turkish reserves. The naval
guns, especially those of the <i>Lizzie</i>, cut them up, but
didn't stagger them. They took the offensive. For a
time it was charge and counter-charge, give and take.
But it couldn't last; the odds were too great. We retired
fighting&mdash;and in that retirement our losses were
something cruel. Machine-guns and shrapnel did the
damage mostly, but the Mausers took their share. Only
in one thing had we the advantage&mdash;the bayonet. When
we got to hand grips with them the Turks couldn't stand
up to our chaps, who went for them with the cold steel
like devils red-hot from hell.</p>

<p>No man who took part in that retirement will ever
forget it. Overhead burst the shells, underfoot the dust
rose and the twigs snapped as the unending rain of rifle,
machine-gun, and shrapnel bullets <i>zipped!</i> and spattered
around. Men fell fast, killed and wounded; every temporary
stand we made was marked by little groups of
grotesquely postured khaki-clad forms still with the stillness
of death. Here and there one saw a sorely wounded
man feebly raise his head and gaze pathetically after the
retiring line of hard-pressed men; others (and these were
many) limped and hobbled painfully along in the wake of
the retreating infantry, till in many cases another bullet
laid them low. Most of our wounded fell into the hands
of the enemy. It was hard to leave them, but what could
we do?</p>

<p>Time after time we tried to dig ourselves in. In vain!
The line had to be shortened, else we should be outflanked
by the enormously superior forces opposed to us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
There was nothing for it but to retire right back to the
ridge and hold the crest&mdash;or try to! Back then we went,
retiring by companies and half-companies. There was
no running, no panic at any time. When the Turks
pressed us too closely we gave them a shake-up with the
bayonet. In many cases men had to rely on the steel
alone, their ammunition giving out. Time after time the
enemy drew back while his big guns and maxims wrought
their will on us. He didn't half like the steel.</p>

<p>We reached the ridge, and, exhausted as we were,
started to dig ourselves in. Our throats were parched,
for we dare not broach our water-bottles lest we should
be tempted to finish them straight away. Once a man
begins to drink he will keep on. In many cases bottles
had been shot through and the contents drained away.
Others had left them with wounded comrades. For food
we munched a biscuit&mdash;when we had time! There
weren't many biscuits eaten until after nightfall.</p>

<p>We dug a line of holes, scratching fiercely with our
trenching tools, all the while subjected to a withering
shrapnel fire. The naval gunners seemed quite unable
to locate and silence the Turkish artillery, so cleverly was
it concealed. Lying down as flat as possible we scraped
away, working frantically for the much-needed cover
that should enable us to hold the position, if it were possible
to hold it. At times we dropped the trenching tools&mdash;to
lift our rifles and beat back the oncoming enemy.
Yet it was evident that the Turks were beginning to feel
the strain too. Perhaps they thought they had us anyhow,
for their assaults began to lose a lot of their sting,
and we were enabled to get a half chance to dig. As
the day waned and nightfall approached they came again,
and we were hard put to it for a time to hang on. Charge
and counter-charge followed rapidly on each other's heels,
and all the time a deafening fire was kept up along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
whole position. Then the brief twilight changed into
night; the fire slackened off; the moon rose, and for the
first time since early morning we were enabled to obtain
a few minutes' rest before going on digging again.</p>

<p>We stuck to it hard all through the night, grafting
away for all we were worth. It was our only chance.
Yet at times we were absolutely forced by sheer fatigue
to drop our tools and stretch out for a spell. Sixteen
hours of hard, solid fighting through a broken and hilly
country, followed by a whole night's digging; then
stand-to before daybreak, and all the succeeding hours of
the second day hold the trenches against intermittent
attacks. At night go on working at strengthening the
trenches; stand-to again before daylight the third day&mdash;and
from before dawn till well on in the evening of that
day do your bit at beating off the enemy's attack in force
with a fresh army that outnumbers you by five to one&mdash;<i>the</i>
attack by which he means to seize your position at <i>all
costs</i>! Just do the foregoing, dear reader, and you will
realise what those Australasian troops endured. And
do it (as they did) on a pint and a half of water and a
few biscuits.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;OVER THE RIDGE&mdash;INTO THE SEA</p>

<p>It was on Tuesday, April 27, that Enver Pasha
launched the attack against our lines that was to drive
us into the sea. All through Monday and Monday night
our transports were landing fresh troops under heavy
and constant shelling from the Turkish big guns; under
cover of the darkness these troops were marched up
and placed, some in the fire trenches to fill up the many
gaps caused by the enemy's shrapnel and machine-guns,
others massed in reserve at the base of the cliff. Yet
not a man of those who had stormed the position the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
day, and who had been hard at it ever since, could be
spared from the front line. Come to think, I don't fancy
a single one would have left it. The feeling had got
abroad that the change was going to be taken out of
the Turks this time (it had leaked out that the big attack
would certainly take place on Monday night or Tuesday
morning), and the chaps were fair mad to get a bit of
their own back. They did, too.</p>

<p>Our position as finally formed extended along the very
crest, or rim, of the cliff for a distance of about two
miles, or rather better. Here and there deep gullies, or
cañons, ran into and cut the line, or caused the line itself
to "bulge" considerably towards the enemy position.
Such was "Shrapnel Gully," at the head of which lay
"Quinn's Post," where our trenches had to be pushed
perilously forward owing to the configuration of the
ground. "Quinn's Post," in fact, formed the key to the
whole position; it lay right in the centre of the line, and
had it been carried the whole bag of tricks would, in my
opinion, have crumpled up badly, and a big disaster might
have occurred. When your centre is pierced it's no
picnic. To the left of "Quinn's" was "Dead Man's
Ridge," held by the Turks, and from which they were
able to snipe right down "Shrapnel Gully"&mdash;and, incidentally,
our camps and dug-outs. It was from "Dead
Man's Ridge" that General Bridges was shot close to
Brigade Headquarters down in the "Gully." No man
was safe from those snipers; they seemed to be everywhere&mdash;before,
alongside, and <i>behind</i> our lines even.
Hence no supplies could be brought up in daylight;
everything had to be done at night when there was only
shell-fire to worry about. Afterwards we got those snipers
fossicked out (they met strange deaths sometimes!),
but in the meantime our life wasn't anything to hanker
after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Now had the enemy only succeeded in pushing us over
the rim of the ridge, nothing would have saved us. Below
lay the open beach. We couldn't possibly have been
taken off with the heights in the hands of the Turks.
I guess it would have been one of the biggest and finest
wipe-outs in history. Old Enver Pasha thought it would
look jolly well in the morning papers, I expect. Anyway
he had no end of a hard try&mdash;and to give him and
his men their due I don't mind admitting that they
weren't so very far from succeeding.</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;STORY OF THE BATTLE OF THE GIANTS</p>

<p>I don't pretend to describe that struggle. No man
could. It was grit, tenacity, and gameness opposed to
overwhelming numbers. A battle of giants. It was
sickening; brutal&mdash;and yet splendid. Men fought that
day stripped to the waist; fought till their rifles jammed,
picked up another&mdash;and went on fighting. Men with
broken legs refused to leave the trench, cursing those who
would have assisted them&mdash;went on firing until a second
bullet crippled their rifle arm. Yet still they clung on,
handing up clips of cartridges to their mates, all the time
imploring them to "give the sons of &mdash;&mdash; hell!" They
weren't Sunday-school models, those big-hearted, happy-go-lucky
toughs from the Back of Beyond. But they
knew how to fight&mdash;and die. They were men right
through, not kid-glove soldiers. They lived hard, fought
hard, and died hard. And what if they did die with
curses on their lips! Who shall dare to judge them,
dying as <i>they</i> died? And it may be that the Big Padre
up aloft turned a deaf ear to those oaths begotten of
the life they had lived&mdash;or perhaps He failed to hear
them in the noise of battle!</p>

<p>The Turks attacked gamely, like the big, brave soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
they are and always were. Led by their splendid officers,
they came on in masses, shoulder to shoulder, and did
all that in them lay to rush our trenches. They were met
by a storm of bullets that would have staggered anything
born of woman. It did stagger them: they recoiled before
that leaden blast that piled their dead and wounded up in
ghastly heaps and ridges like broken-down walls&mdash;before
that smashing fire delivered at twenty yards range. They
recoiled&mdash;yes. But run&mdash;no! They charged, charged
right through that hurricane of machine-gun and rifle
fire&mdash;charged right up to our parapets.</p>

<p>And now it was our turn. Like one man the colonial
infantry leaped from their cover. <i>Crash!</i> They were
into the Turks. Followed a wild hurly-burly of hacking
and stabbing while one might count twenty slowly; then
the enemy were beaten back, and the defenders ran,
limped, and crawled back to their trenches and took to
their rifles again.</p>

<p>Thus it went on from before dawn till towards evening.
Charge and counter-charge, till men reeled from sheer
exhaustion, and their blood-clotted weapons slipped from
hands sticky with the same red paint. I am not exaggerating!
those who were present on that awful Tuesday
will bear me out.</p>

<p>We were hard pressed. The strongest men in the
world are only human. Loss of sleep, insufficient food,
and practically no water, combined with the exertions
we had already gone through, began to tell their tale.
Our losses were also very heavy; and owing to the slippery
state of the clay soil, following on an all-night of
rain, our reserves could not get up quickly enough. Thus
yards and yards of trench were at times empty of all
save dead and wounded men, and in some cases the
Turks effected a footing in them; they were always
driven out again, however, or bayoneted to a man. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
fellows were simply magnificent; budge they would not.
To capture those trenches meant the killing of the men
who held them; you couldn't <i>drive</i> them out. And the
officers were just the same.</p>

<p>But it was cruel to hear the continual cries of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stretcher-bearers!&mdash;Stretcher-bearers to the right!"</p>

<p>"Stretcher-bearers to the left!"</p>

<p>"<i>Ammunition!</i> Send up ammunition&mdash;we haven't a&mdash;&mdash;round
here!"</p>

<p>"Reinforce! <i>For God's sake reinforce!</i> They're into
No. 8! <i>Christ! boys, get a move on!</i>"</p>

<p>At this time we had neither support trenches nor communications&mdash;just
one thin line, which, if broken, meant
the loss of the ridge with all that <i>that</i> meant. We were
also so clogged up with dead in our trenches that to make
room for the living we had to throw the bodies over the
back. In many cases where our line was cut on the edge
of the ridge these bodies rolled right down to the foot
of the cliff. At "Quinn's Post" things were about as bad
as they could be. There was only the merest apology for
a track from the "Gully" up to the trenches situated on
the very lip of the crest, and at one time when reinforcements
were making their way in single file up this track
they had to scramble in and out through and over dead
men lying tossed about anyhow, while all the way, right
down to the valley the wounded were lying "heads and
tails" awaiting transport to the beach. It wasn't the most
encouraging sight in the world for the fellows coming
up straight off the transports.</p>

<p>In one place quite a little stack of bodies had been
huddled together to one side of the track; there might
have been eighteen or twenty in the lot. Owing to the
water running down this stack began to move, and kept
on moving till it blocked the track up altogether. I
don't know how many chaps tumbled into that heap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and got tied up in it, but eventually a fatigue party had
to be told off to build up the bodies as you would build
sheaves on a wagon. We had no time to bury our dead
for the first few days&mdash;and in that climate you don't
want to keep them above ground for many <i>hours</i>.</p>

<p>As the day wore on it became evident that the Turks
had shot their bolt. The attack died down, then ceased
altogether, and save for the heavy rifle and artillery fire
they kept up on our trenches, we weren't troubled by
them for some time. They had lost tremendously; the
ground along our front looked like a heavy crop of wheat
after the binder had been through it&mdash;either 4000 or
7000 dead lay there. (And they lay there unburied for
<i>three weeks</i>.) At last we were able to get a little sorely
needed rest. We had been pushed to the extremest limit
of human endurance.</p>

I&mdash;STORY OF THE CARBINEERS IN AFRICA</p>

<p>The story of the campaign of German Southwest
Africa is written, plain for all time, across the sands of
that amazing country, and an empty bully-beef tin, half-buried
in the flank of a tawny sand-dune, is eloquent of
most of its detail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The week that followed upon our second taking of
Fort Grasplatz brought us a passing interest in new arrivals:
the Natal Carbineers, the Pretoria Regiment, the
Kaffrarian Rifles, a battery of the Natal Field Artillery,
the Eastern Rifles, the 1st Kimberley Regiment, and&mdash;it
was whispered&mdash;a brand-new Brigadier with a brand-new
Staff to match.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>A bare note in my diary states simply that they came.
Of the order of their coming is no mention, but then, not
even official records, I believe, could have lucidly sustained
the sandstorm that snarled over Luderitzbucht
throughout the whole of that infernal week. Through it
were caught glimpses, here and there, of herds of baggage-laden
infantry being driven to allotted camping-grounds;
of spick-and-span Carbineers striving desperately
to maintain the dignity of their spurs&mdash;and almost
succeeding; of kicking mules and cursing drivers; strings
of horses, wagons, guns, more drivers (still cursing),
native scouts, poultice-wallopers (courtesy title of the
S.A.M.C.), and all the rag-tag and bobtail of our amateur
army.</p>

<p>A hard-bitten company of the Veterinary Corps drifted
down upon us, and asked if there was beer: they had
heard&mdash;&mdash;. We told them, Yes; there was beer, but there
was none now. We were sorry. Whereupon, and without
enthusiasm, they said that it didn't matter, and drifted
away, still searching. Others, but these were of the infantry,
forlorn units blown from all knowledge of their
whereabouts, we found huddled under the lee of buildings.
They bleated at us joylessly, and asked many questions.
Was this a sandstorm? Were there many Germans
about? and&mdash;but this was inevitable and unvaried&mdash;had
we found many diamonds?</p>

<p>We would usually tell them that our kit-bags could
hold no more, whereupon they would break down and
beg to be taken back to their regiments. We did not, of
course, entertain the slightest knowledge of their regiments'
whereabouts, but, as something was obviously expected
of us, we would indicate variously all four points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of the compass, and they would thank us effusively and
merge away, one by one, into the muffled landscape.</p>

<p>Sandstorms, however, do not last for ever, and there
came at last a day when the unchanged hills looked down
upon neat acres of canvas and a new and startling activity.
All of our immediate world was become a geometric
pattern. Wagons, scores upon scores of them,
stood axle to axle in a faultless precision that led the eye
along ruled lines to ordered rows of water-carts and
tethered mules. A group of these last had broken loose,
and half a dozen mathematicians with long-handled whips
were chasing them back into equational order. Beyond,
again, right-angled horse lines and a criss-cross pattern
of tents which was the Natal Carbineers' camp played
with the Natal Field Artillery's 15-pounders at being an
Euclidic proposition. Which, of course, was absurd.</p>

<p>It has somewhere been said that an Army represents
the only true democracy. This is not true. Nowhere is
there so nice a class distinction as in the Army, and nowhere,
perhaps, is that nicety so candidly maintained.
We, the I.L.H., would not at that time have even
dreamed of visiting the infantry, but we called upon the
Carbineers because, simply, they were "mounted men,"
and as such our equals. Later, months later, out of the
common thirst and the sandstorms&mdash;all men are alike in
a sandstorm&mdash;there grew the reluctant conviction that
active service brings to pass a sort of socialistic millennium
in which regiments are judged only by their performances,
and in which officers may at times speak quite
respectfully to their men, and men almost respectfully of
their officers. That the <i>moral</i> of the mounted man is
usually superior to that of the "foot-slogger" may be attributed
solely to the superior <i>moral</i> of the horse that he
rides. This last is an epigram, but true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>


<p>II&mdash;TALES OF THE NATAL FIELD ARTILLERY</p>

<p>The Natal Field Artillery, too, were on our visiting
list, and we found them to be excellent fellows. We
swapped lies with them; we pronounced their guns to
be the loot of some museum&mdash;they were not, certainly,
of the newest type&mdash;and we greedily borrowed all the
newspapers that they had brought with them.</p>

<p>It was in the N.F.A. lines, by the way, one white-hot
noon, that I almost tripped over the super-philosopher.
He was Irish, which perhaps makes his philosophy the
less remarkable, and he sat upon an upturned soap-box
and toyed with a dish of something that sounded like
camp stew.</p>

<p>There was a sudden noise, the sort of noise that makes
a grown-up say to a child: "You should put your hand
before your mouth when you do that!" and I heard,
rather than saw, the super-philosopher clear his mouth
of some objectionable morsel. I looked round, and his
pale eye closed with mine. "Praise th' saints!" he said,
"thim ants have no bones into thim!"</p>

<p>Our interest in the arrivals did not last long. A new
sandstorm blew up and swallowed them, and when, weeks
later, it spat them out again, they had all but lost their
identity as far as we were concerned. The infantry became
known to us simply as "foot-sloggers;" the Carbineers,
from a weakness for polishing their riding-boots,
became "the Cherry Blossom Brigade;" and we, the
I.L.H., were known to all and sundry as the "Illicit Liquor
Hunters." I do not think, however, that we should
have minded so much if there had been any liquor left
to hunt.</p>

<p>We were kept hard at work, too, and we soon learned
that the "in-betweens" were more profitably to be spent in
what we called "blanket-drill," and what our N.C.O.'s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
when they were not indulging in it themselves, called
"darned laziness," than in afternoon calls upon strangers
who had so thoroughly taken upon themselves the color
of their surroundings as to have become as supremely uninteresting
as ourselves.</p>

<p>The deep groaning noise that a trumpet makes at dawn,
and which field-officers and poets call "réveillé," and turn
over again and snore at, when by some rare chance, they
hear it, was to us the first note in a symphony of labor
that was to last all day. Who has heard the howls of execration
that uprise from a sleeping camp at its first note
will appreciate the truth of what I say. The utter hopelessness
of any resistance to its summons is, perhaps,
what galls most. Turn you never so deaf an ear, you
will still have the chilling conviction that some N.C.O.,
with more liver than bowels of compassion, is waiting
"outside" to mark you down as an absentee from roll-call.</p>

<p>Réveillé, roll-call, arms inspection, morning stables, alleged
breakfast, stable fatigue, mounted squadron drill,
watering and feeding horses, and musketry instruction
took us by gentle stages as far as lunch-time. After
lunch (save the mark! but is sand, disguised as Irish
stew, lunch?), Swedish drill, sectional skirmishing on
foot, and an odd quarter-master's fatigue or so thrown
in, would lead us on to evening stables. That accomplished,
we were at liberty&mdash;those, at least, of us who
were not on guard for the night&mdash;to prepare our evening
meal and to retire to our blankets, where, masters of
ourselves at last, we could&mdash;the writer certainly did on
one occasion&mdash;dream that one-eyed camels of malevolent
aspect chased us through interminable leagues of sandstorm,
and finally drove us into seas of greasy Irish
stew, wherefrom emerged horrid shapes that lectured us
on the care of rifles and the virtues of discipline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>How we longed for war, if only for its comparative
peace!</p>

<p>Not all our days were gray days, however. There
came a period when each morning saw us, clad mainly
in pipes and towels, taking our horses down to a landlocked
arm of the sea, where the hills stood up in their
glory around us, and where flamingoes, in their stately
phalanxes, waded the still shallows or flung in broad-pinioned
ease to some further sand-bank; where black seals
bobbed greeting to us from the dipping waters, and where
we could forget the sandstorms of yesterday and to-morrow.</p>

<p>Horses, we found, made excellent diving boards, and
lent themselves, besides, to a type of chariot-racing that
I have not met elsewhere. For this form of sport it is
essential to have two horses, and it usually became one's
painful duty, therefore, to borrow the mount of some
other man, preferably a non-swimmer, when he was
not looking, and then to make for deep water&mdash;where he
could not follow&mdash;with as little delay as possible. Remained
then only to so contrive oneself as to stand with
a foot on the back of each animal, and to keep them
swimming sufficiently near together to allow one to retain
some sort of balance. Sometimes one would succeed,
but usually, and in spite of extreme efforts, the
contrary beasts would swim more and more widely apart,
until overtaxed powers of doing the splits would end in a
ducking as ignominious as inevitable.</p>

<p>I remember an occasion when, after a long and tiring
patrol, we had ridden our horses into the shallows to cool
their legs, a school of ground-sharks suddenly appeared,
almost literally, under their very noses. The White
Knight in "Alice in Wonderland," who made his horse
wear spiked anklets against the danger of shark-bite,
must have foreseen some such contingency; but then, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
he been with us, he would have fallen off, I feel sure, in
the smother of spray and panic which the experience
cost us.</p>


<p>III&mdash;WILD RIDE OF THE WATER PATROL</p>

<p>One of our duties at this time was the providing of
an escort to the water ration that left Luderitzbucht each
morning for Kolmanskoppe.</p>

<p>The water was taken in mule-drawn trolleys along the
railway line (we possessed no other "rolling stock" at
that time) and as it was the sole supply of the two infantry
regiments stationed there, extreme care had to be
taken to prevent its being intercepted by a stray German
patrol.</p>

<p>On October 7, No. 3 Troop had supplied the convoy,
and we, whose turn it was to do so on the morrow, had
spent the greater part of the day in the sweet frame of
mind that is bred by camp fatigues, and at four o'clock
in the afternoon were waiting for the order to "break
away" from a squadron drill that seemed as if it would
never end. The other troops had dismissed long ago,
and we asked ourselves with some bitterness why we
should be kept out in the heat and sand playing at circuses,
and all the while the sharp words of command
stabbed through the curtain of dust that followed us, and
punctuated our grumbling. "On the left fo-orm troop!"
Some one, hand-jostled by a section in rear, cursed aloud,
and we laughed as we went forward at the picturesque
phrase he had used. "Sections right!" The sand-fog
rose more thickly about us. Was this farce never going
to end? "Ha-alt!" Ah! This was the order for which
we had been waiting. The "dismiss" would follow, and
there was still time if we hurried for a bathe before evening
stables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>But our O.C. had apparently forgotten us. He was
gazing with something of an air of abstraction at a soldierly
horseman making towards us from the direction
of the camp.</p>

<p>There was nothing really extraordinary in the sight of
that figure (we could recognize him, by the big, upstanding
gray that he rode, as the Colonel's orderly), yet something&mdash;his
obvious hurry perhaps&mdash;made us forget our
anxiety to be dismissed.</p>

<p>A minute later he had pulled up before our troop
leader. "Colonel D&mdash;&mdash;n's compliments, sir! and you
are to report to him at once!" And then, in the confidential
tone that orderlies learn from their constant association
with the higher ranks: "Water guard, sir!" I
could just catch the words: "... German patrol ...
one ... chap wounded.... What's that, sir?...
Yes, one of our fellows."</p>

<p>"Sections right! Wa-alk 'arch! Tr-r-ot!" There was
life in the order this time, and there was life, too, in our
quick response. The horses even seemed to be infected,
and we had to hold them a little as we pounded along
in the wake of the news-bringer.</p>

<p>"Steady, there! Ye don't want to ride the sentries
down, do ye?" The camp buildings had leaped out at
us from the yellow haze of our own progress, and the
corporal of the guard had flattened himself against a
wall&mdash;just in time. We pulled up and rode in soberly.
Men of other troops dashed at us and held our horses.
"Lucky devils!" they said, and bade us get our bandoliers
and rifles. From them we learned that a German patrol
had lain in wait for the water convoy at a point some
three miles up the line, had potted one of our men through
the thigh, and had retired without our fellows being able
to fire a shot in exchange, and now, we&mdash;"lucky 4," they
called us&mdash;were going out to hunt them. "And I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
suppose they've gone far," one informed me. "I expect
they'll be waiting for you, an' p'raps they'll shoot one of
you. I know I hope they will&mdash;you lucky, lucky devils!"</p>

<p>Into the press of chaff and counter-chaff, and the excitement
of straps and buckles, rode one, speaking with
the large voice of small authority, and hung about with
"the complete campaigner's outfit." Not a detail&mdash;if we
except the camp-stretcher and the cork-mattress&mdash;was
missing. Water-bottle, haversack, prismatic compass,
field-glasses, first-aid outfit, and sand goggles&mdash;the White
Knight again!</p>

<p>As a quick-change artist he should have commanded
our ready admiration. As it was, he provided just that
sobering touch of humor that we needed. "Goin' to
take all week to get ready?" he queried with that heavy
urbanity which N.C.O.'s and stage managers mistake for
satire, "... passel o' ladies' maids!"</p>

<p>"Oh! you&mdash;you May queen!" I heard some one say,
and the troop giggled helplessly as we swung into our
saddles. "Number off from the right!" the order was
barked at us.</p>

<p>"One"&mdash;"two"&mdash;"three"&mdash;&mdash;. The fourth man was
having trouble with his pony and was far too busy to
think of mere numbers, and the White Knight glared
down the line of us as if, in some way, just outside his
comprehension, we were all to blame. "As you were!"
he snapped&mdash;it sounded like "Zwear!" "Number off
from the ri&mdash;&mdash;" "No time for that now, Sergeant!"
spoke the crisp voice of the O.C. from somewhere behind
us. "Sections left! Walk! march! Tr-r-ot!" and the
quick dust rose to the forward surge of horses and men,
and we were off.</p>

<p>Five minutes later we had passed the outlying pickets
of the Transvaal Scottish, and were kicking up the sand
at a good hand-canter along the hill-girt railway line to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Kolmanskuppe. There is a peculiar exhilaration in this
form of sport (I cannot easily use the term "warfare"
in regard to a game wherein all that is ordinarily known
as "patriotism" is swallowed up and lost in a wholesome,
primal, man's desire to hunt man&mdash;the royalist of royal
game&mdash;for the sake, only, of the game's lust), and if
in G.S.W. we were rather like the famous American
hunter who had never been known to kill anything, but
who "just hunted"&mdash;well, such little killing as did come
our way proved conclusively that "just hunting" held all
the breathless joy of the thing and left no&mdash;aftertaste.</p>

<p>For some miles we held our pace, and the heavy,
springless sand through which we rode flung its yellow
veil about us. There was the sound of wind in our ears,
and the creaking of saddle-leather, a vague surging noise,
as of a heavy ground-swell sucking through rocks, and,
over all, the choking, blinding pall of dust. An oath,
back-flung from a leading section where a horse had
stumbled, sounded smothered and unreal. Now and
again an outcrop of bare granite would leap out to meet
us, and the brief thunder of our passing would shout
back from the echoing hills; then sand again, and its
muffled tumult.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF THE TROOPERS ON TRAIL OF
THE AMBUSHERS</p>

<p>The valley became narrower, and a hint of coolness
stole down the sudden shadows. All on a moment a
swift hand plucked the sunlight from us, and the jaws
of the hills closed suddenly about our path&mdash;closed,
closed, until the ribbon of steel that we knew to be the
railway line looked like a tongue lolling from the cleft
grin before us. There was a silence in that place, and
our horses pricked quick, apprehensive ears to it. "What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
a place for an ambush!" said some one of my section,
and the angry "Don't be a fool!" of the man to whom he
had spoken showed that three of us, at least, were thinking
of the same thing. The click of a steel-shod hoof
striking against stone, and&mdash;"click!" back would come the
answer of the rocks; just the sort of noise that the bolt
of a Mauser rifle makes when it is drawn back to &mdash;&mdash;.
Well, speaking personally, I do not suppose that I should
have noticed it if my horse hadn't jumped so.</p>

<p>It was here, or hereabouts, that our patrol had been
fired on only a few hours before, and we had received
no particular assurance that ours was not likely to be
a similar experience. On the contrary, every breathing
instant was pregnant with possibility, and, be it said, a
sort of half-shrinking hope.</p>

<p>A barrier of great boulders, through which the line
won a bare clearance, stood suddenly up against us. Just
the place for an ambush; but nothing happened save, perhaps,
that one was conscious more of one's own breathing
after it was passed. A hundred yards or so farther on
the hills to our right fell away in a great curve, and
sheeted sunlight lay on all the place; orange, streaked
with silver of drift-sand on the shining plain, while beyond,
and high above all, white-faced crags swam on an
opal-hearted mist. To our right a mad sunset flared
above the purple-footed hills, and pointed long, scornful,
shadow-fingers at us. Sunset? or drunken magic? Saffron
there was, and duck's-egg green lying on amber;
amber that dripped molten gold, and tipped with splendid
color the peaks which stood up blackly against it; amber,
shot with blush-rose and slashed with fierce scarlet: a
breathless wonder that changed while we watched it&mdash;changed
and deepened until all the painted sky was a
blood-clotted glory.</p>

<p>Night had stepped into the valley in which we rode, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
I was not sorry when my section was picked out for
"flanking work," and we were sent at a sharp trot to the
foot-hills and the sunlight. We were told to keep slightly
in advance of the troop, and, as the broken nature of the
ground allowed, about three hundred yards distant from
the railway line, the idea being, of course, that should
an enemy patrol be waiting for us among the rocks, we&mdash;"the
advance screen"&mdash;would draw their fire, and so secure
some measure of safety for our main body. A leading
section was sent off to the shadow-land on the right
of the line, and, looking back when we had ridden some
hundred yards or so, I saw two other sections detach
themselves from the main body, and drop back, to the
right and left respectively, as a sort of extended rearguard.</p>

<p>"As the nature of the ground allowed!" The words
were the letter of our instructions; the exclamation mark,
as <i>Punch</i> might say, was ours when the first gentle slope
that we negotiated jumped suddenly up into a hog-backed
"krantz," that looked as if it might strain even a klipspringer.
It had to be done, however, and we laid ourselves
on our horses' necks and let them go at it. What
a breathless scramble it was! Loose shale avalanched
about us, and steel-shod hoofs slipped and struck, and
struck and slipped again on the crisp granite, and just
when it seemed to me that nothing was left but to dismount
and pull my horse up after me, there was a last,
furious straining of willing muscles, a plunge that shook
my hat over my eyes, and the four of us were landed in
a hard-breathing bunch on a sort of shelf of rock. A
girth had slipped, and we paused while it was tightened,
and looked back. The troop was halted&mdash;while we attained
our position, I supposed&mdash;and as we watched, a
figure rode clear of the others and signaled agitatedly
to us to advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>It was comparatively easy, from our elevation, to select
a route that conformed measurably to our instructions
and to the opposing factor of our own instinct of self-preservation.
Only comparatively easy, however, because
distances that looked flat, or, at the most, but gently
tilted, proved on closer inspection to be almost worth
the serious consideration of an Alpine Club. But we
managed to scramble along somehow. When possible,
we even went farther into the spirit of our instructions,
and rode in extended formation, but, although our horses
displayed an amazing aptitude for rock-work, we usually
found ourselves progressing in single file. Once, I remember,
when a flat surface of rock tempted us to something
approaching a trot, we pulled up only a few yards
short of where the hill ended abruptly, and lay, piled
about its own foot, hundreds of feet below. It was from
there, too, that we first caught sight of the white buildings
of Kolmanskuppe, some two or three miles away, but although
it was a cheering sight, we went on from that
place with much sedateness and circumspection. All serious
thought of meeting the enemy patrol had vanished,
of course, with that first glimpse of "civilization." Only
one ordeal now remained: to get ourselves down, out of
that region of sunlight and breathlessness, to where, with
the lesser hills, began the last phase of our journey.</p>

<p>One attempt landed us in a cul-de-sac of tumbled granite,
another on a tongue of rock that would have proved
perfectly negotiable if the tongue had not been bitten
short, or if there had been a bridge across the forty-foot
chasm that grinned up at us; but, eventually, by winding
in single file round a spur of rock where a false step
meant&mdash;as one of us said and giggled so much at, that he
all but put his assertion to the proof&mdash;"more than a bad
cold" for the man who slipped, we found a steep slope
wheredown we tobogganed with safety and some amusement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to ourselves, but not a little detriment, I think, to
the tails of our horses.</p>


<p>V&mdash;SCOUTING ON THE EDGE OF THE DESERT</p>

<p>The troop, we found, had taken courage of the less imposing
scenery, and were just visible in a cloud of dust
some half a mile ahead of us. Just outside Kolmanskuppe
the railway line takes a sharp bend to the left, and
as half a mile in the rear does not exactly correspond
with the M.I. hand-book's definition of an advance
guard's position, we kicked up our tired animals and made
a desperate effort, by cutting across the angle of the line,
to regain some measure of dignity. What the troop
thought when, some ten minutes later, we reappeared in
advance of them, I do not know. They looked rather
indifferent, I thought, and when, soon afterwards, a
ragged fringe of infantry appeared on the sky-line above
us&mdash;Kolmanskuppe is on the edge of the desert proper,
and looks as if it had been washed up by the sea of
mountainous sand-dunes&mdash;and the troop, realizing apparently
that there was really no need to follow its meticulous
course along the railway metals, wheeled sharply
to the right, we cantered down and, with all humility, tied
ourselves on to its tail.</p>

<p>In the number of its houses, Kolmanskuppe is not a
large place; in the extent covered by such buildings as
there are it is quite considerable. An average distance
of about one hundred yards between the houses, and the
glaring monotony of their design stifles any desire on the
part of the visitor unduly to prolong his tour of inspection.</p>

<p>In the ordinary sense we were not, of course, visitors,
and besides, we had "done" Kolmanskuppe, more thoroughly
than an American tourist does Rome, on a previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
occasion. Then, we had been actuated by other
than guide-book motives, and now, its interest gone, the
place was become an eyesore, and we wanted to go home.
That, we supposed, was why we got the order to off-saddle.</p>

<p>The one picturesque touch in the picture was supplied
by our three camels. They were there on some water-carrying
pretext, and they recognized us from afar off,
and came and stood to windward of us so that there could
be no remote possibility of our not recognizing them.</p>

<p>We never seemed, somehow, to be able to get away
from those three gaunt beasts. No matter the direction
of our journeyings, we always met them sooner or later.
We should not, of course, have minded if they had shown
any signs of awakening affection for us, but they didn't.
It was their sneering indifference to our presence that
galled us most, I think. Had we been in the habit of
thrusting ourselves upon them, this attitude would have
been understandable, even commendable; but we didn't
thrust ourselves upon them. They hatched deliberate
plots to meet us in unexpected places, and when we met
they sneered at us, and besides, as I have said elsewhere,
they smelt abominably. In very truth, Tartarin of Tarascon
was not more haunted by his own camel than were
we by our three.</p>

<p>The corporal who was in charge of them slouched to
us from somewhere out of the desert&mdash;he was borrowing
habits right and left from his camels, we often told him&mdash;and
gave us the cheerful information that we were to
convoy some wagons back to Luderitzbucht, which wagons,
he added, were only then being off-loaded. Dusk
was spreading like a gray blanket across the face of the
sands, and the prospect of a night ride at the tail of a
string of creaking wagons was not enticing. We asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
him how he knew, and he retired into his newly acquired
camelism, and went off to his uncouth beasts.</p>

<p>But he was right, and an hour later saw us&mdash;or heard
us rather, for it was pitch dark&mdash;starting on such a ride
as I hope never again to suffer. The road from Kolmanskuppe
to Luderitzbucht is rendered distinct from
the country through which it runs by means of white-painted
paraffin tins placed at irregular intervals along its
alleged sides. That it does not otherwise differ to any
marked extent from the surrounding country is due less,
I think, to the surveyor than to the country, which is
mainly precipices and small but very knobby hills. I
have since traveled that road in the daytime, and its unrelieved
roughness&mdash;unless an occasional wallow in deep
sand can be called relief&mdash;makes of it a thing to be remembered;
but of that night, when our nostrils, and our
throats, and our eyes were filled with the dust kicked up
by close upon a hundred mules and half as many horses,
and our ears were deafened by the harsh thunder of
empty wagons bouncing into and out of deep holes and
over fire-spitting granite boulders, recollection is a mere
headache.</p>

<p>For the first half-mile or so&mdash;my section had now become
the rearguard&mdash;we rode at some fifty yards behind
the last wagon. We did this for several reasons: firstly,
because the air was less full of dust at that distance;
secondly, because we could more or less select our own
pace instead of having, every now and then, to pull our
horses back upon their haunches to avoid spitting them
on the brake handle of a wagon stopped suddenly in its
drunken career by virtue of collision with some more
than usually imposing obstruction; and thirdly&mdash;but this
I do not think was a real reason&mdash;because we had been
ordered to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>


<p>VI&mdash;THE FRIGHTENED HORSES&mdash;AND THE
CAMELS</p>

<p>We were going down some unseen slope, I remember,
when the change occurred. My horse was plunging a
good deal, and I had to use both hands to prevent his
getting away from me. The man on my right seemed to
be having similar difficulty with his animal. Strange!
they were all quiet enough a minute ago, and now&mdash;&mdash;"Look
out!" The words were shot at me by No. 3 of the
section as, with his horse completely out of control, he
raced past me into the darkness and the dust. "Rummy,"
said the man on my right, "I don't know what's the matter
with the beasts. They're scared out of their lives, that
I'll swear&mdash;Good Lord!" His ejaculation was spoken
away from me, for his pony had swung suddenly about
with a quick, frightened movement, and was now staring
into the blackness from whence we had come. A moment
later and my own beast had spun around. We
waited in silence.</p>

<p>"Where's T&mdash;&mdash;?" said the other man suddenly.
(T&mdash;&mdash; was of my section, and I seemed vaguely to
remember that he had been riding behind us.) If my
memory was right, then T&mdash;&mdash; was somewhere out
there in the blackness, and the&mdash;the&mdash;whatever it was
that was frightening our horses was out there with him.
It was not a nice thought. We waited again, and I found
myself wondering what it would sound like to call out
T&mdash;&mdash;'s name, when out of the darkness came the
sound of a snort, followed by what seemed like the frenzied
plunging of some heavy beast. Then a voice uplifted
itself in earnest supplication, and the voice was the
voice of T&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>He seemed to be calling upon the name of a god not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
altogether orthodox. I caught, here and there, strong
expressions of his disapproval of some person or thing.
The voice was growing louder and clearer, and it became
obvious that T&mdash;&mdash; was being borne towards us
at a high rate of speed. The pale sheet of the sky held
him in silhouette for an instant, and then he flung down
upon us in a perfect flood of invective.</p>

<p>I had never heard him talk quite like that before. It
was really, and almost literally, illuminating, and we
reined aside in a sort of reverential awe to let him pass.
He did so on the wings of some of the most golden eloquence
that it has ever been my lot to hear. "Goddam!"
I heard distinctly, followed by a string of words which
I do not know how to spell; and then some fine but
strictly censorable phrases, out of which I collected fragments
that made a disconnected yet interesting whole. In
this way I was puzzled for some moments by the many
variations of the word camel. "Camel!" I found myself
saying, "camel!" when "Look!" said the other man suddenly,
and I looked, and saw striding down upon us
from the same pale sheet of sky that had held T&mdash;&mdash;
only a few minutes before three gaunt, long-legged shadows.</p>

<p>"The camels!" said the other man, and I looked at
him, and he looked at me, and what there was in that
shrouding darkness to tell each other what the other
thought I do not know; but, as our frenzied horses
waltzed and plunged away from the acrid fear behind
them, we clung to our saddles with both hands, and
rocked and choked with insane laughter. Later, when
we met T&mdash;&mdash;, leading a dead-lame pony out of the
rocks, we broke out afresh, and between paroxysms, told
him something of our admiring respect. Indeed, a man
who could steer a madly racing pony through pitch darkness
and over and between rocks, and at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
conduct ably a rhetorical discourse on the (presumed)
illegitimacy of camels and the moral degeneracy of men
who ride upon them, well deserved some more tangible
expression of merit than was held in mere words. Iron
crosses have been given for less.</p>

<p>The remainder of that ride left to us only recurring
fits of laughter, dust, and noise and darkness, and when
the camels came too near, which, in spite of concise injunctions
to them to go "to another place," they often did,
spasms of wrathful and sulphurous abuse.</p>

<p>A note in my diary says of our return to Luderitzbucht:
"Surprised to find myself looking on the beastly
place as 'home!'"</p>

<p>But was there real cause for surprise?</p>

<p>(The narrator here begins to tell about "Alarums and
Excursions" along the African deserts; a wild night ride;
hunting the Germans like big game; and numberless anecdotes
that put the African fever into one's blood.)</p>

<h2>LAST WORDS OF A "SOLDIER AND
DRAMATIST"</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Letters of Harold Chapin</i><br />
<br />
<i>An American Who Died for England at Loos,
on September 26, 1915</i>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>The story of Harold Chapin's life and death is a glorious page
in the annals of the Great War. This brilliant, young dramatist
was born in Brooklyn in 1888. His mother is an actress and
when the boy was seven years old, he made his first appearance
on the stage in the Memorial Theater, Stratford-on-Avon,
England, where his mother was engaged to play during a
Shakespeare festival. From this youthful beginning, he developed
into an actor, producer, and dramatist of great ability,
gaining a reputation on both continents. When war was declared
on August 4th, 1914, Harold Chapin found that "he could
not act, he could not write" he could think only of the war
and the world bowed in tragedy. Finally, on September 2, 1914,
he enlisted in the R. A. M. C. The artist and dreamer became
an enthusiastic soldier. While fighting at the battle of Loos,
he was killed on Sunday, September 26, 1915. He was only 29
years of age but "he had lived worthily and he died gloriously."
The letters which Harold Chapin wrote to his mother, his wife,
and his little son have been published in this country in book
form by the <i>John Lane Company</i>, under the title "Soldier and
Dramatist." They form a notable contribution to the war's
literature. Several of the letters are here reprinted by permission
of the publishers from the hundred or more in the
published collection: Copyright 1916.</p></blockquote>

I&mdash;STORY OF HOW HAROLD CHAPIN DIED</p>

<p><i>The following letter from Mr. Richard Capell one of
Harold Chapin's comrades, was the first intimation Mrs.
Chapin received of her husband's death. It was, of
course, written hurriedly and under trying conditions,
but it gives so touching and dramatic an account of
Harold Chapin's last days, that it is felt that it must be
included in this book exactly as it was received.</i></p>

<div class="right">October 3rd, 1915.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mrs. Chapin</span>,</p>

<p>I beg you to accept my heartfelt condolences. I would
not so much as hint at the word consolation to you after
this unutterably cruel blow,&mdash;even to us, his chance
friends of less than a year, it seems too cruel to be realisable,&mdash;were
it not that I can give you some account, at
first hand, of the splendid work of your husband on those
days, September 25th and 26th. It must surely be, eventually,
a consolation to you to think that he died no mean,
casual death, but that he was shot down (on the afternoon
of Sunday a week ago) when actually on an errand
of help, and after giving himself up for hour after hour
to heavy and perilous toil for the wounded. I have been
at some pains to get for you some details of that fatal
afternoon, but I cannot&mdash;the reason will be obvious&mdash;now
tell you quite all there is. The essential is that on
Sunday morning an appeal came to our station for
stretcher-bearers to assist a battalion, seven of whose
bearers were out of action. Your husband and two other
men set out for the trenches in question, which were to
the south-west of Loos. The journey, itself, had its
perils. Over the distance of two miles or thereabouts,
the Germans, who were rallying after their defeat of the
day before, could enfilade our ground. One day I will
explain the position with precision. The three of them
eventually reached the series of trenches at a moment
when the Germans were counter-attacking, and were told
by an officer that stretcher-work was impossible at such
a moment. It was suicide to show one's head above the
parapet. This was, of course, one of the old German
trenches, and the enemy fire came both from front and
right flank. Chapin consequently told the two others to
wait for him while he reported to the medical officer who
had appealed in the morning, his intention being to return
to collect the wounded after dark, as we did during the
week as a matter of routine. The two never saw him
again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<p>Our line that afternoon wavered for a moment, before
the counter-attack. There was a short period of confusion,
and some of our men were caught in the open by
German rifle and machine-gun fire. You may possibly
one day get an exact account from an actual eye-witness,
but from what I can piece together, your husband went
over the parapet to fetch in some wounded man. He was
certainly shot in the foot. It appears that he persisted
and was then killed outright by a shot through the head.</p>

<p>Our work was so exacting at that moment, that hours
passed before Chapin's absence was noticed at our station,
and it was not till the following morning that we
felt anxious.</p>

<p>I pass over a series of extravagant adventures that
befell me as I made my way, then, to your husband's
destination of the day before, with the idea of getting
first-hand information. I found myself on the scene
when the English were making a further attack. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
impossible, in daylight, to go into the open, but I found
from a medical officer that a lance-corporal of the
R.A.M.C. had, the night before, been seen dead over
the parapet. The English attack, that afternoon, improved
the position. The next morning, we had a run
out there; your husband had been buried in the night
near where he fell. I went down on Wednesday to the
trenches, saw the officer who had been in charge of the
burial party, and eventually got the papers, watch, etc.,
which were found on his body. These you will have
received by now, I suppose. There can be no harm in
telling you that he lies with six other London Territorials,
within a few hundred yards of Loos cemetery.</p>

<p>If I have the pleasure of seeing you again, when this
ghastly business is over, I will tell you something of
Chapin's fine work on the Saturday, collecting wounded
on the wire before the first captured German trench.
For many hours I was out there with him;&mdash;heart-breaking
conditions, twenty appeals for help where one could
only heed one; rain for hour after hour, and no little
annoyance from cross-fire. On one journey, three of us
(your husband was one) came in for a tempest of fire.
Two of us lay low with the laden stretcher on the grass,
while your husband volunteered to go ahead into the
village, using a communication trench to bring back the
"wheels," by which we get stretchers along at a good
pace over roads. Eventually the tempest ended, and the
whole day ended without casualties for us. We went
to bed at midnight for two hours. Before daybreak I
joined a party that was going to Loos, and so began the
fatal Sunday.</p>

<p>If, dear Mrs. Chapin, you succeed in getting more detailed
information of your husband's death it will be
from some one or another in the 17th Battalion London
Regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>I feel that I am intruding on your grief. Excuse me,
and believe me, with profound sympathy,</p>

<p>II&mdash;LETTER TO HIS SON ON HIS BIRTHDAY</p>


<div class="right"><span class="smcap">St. Albans</span>, Dec. 21st, 1914.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Darling</span>,</p>

<p>This is your birthday! The day I'm writing on I
mean, of course you won't get the letter till to-morrow
so what you will have to say is "yesterday <i>was</i> my Birthday
and Doody wrote on the evening of my Birthday."</p>

<p>I'm not sending you any present for your Birthday
because I can't afford to send two presents in one week.
I am sending you a present for Xmas instead.</p>

<p>I am coming home to see you again soon and we'll
have an awfully good time together. We might go to the
Zoo together if I can get Sunday tickets.</p>

<p>Good night my little boy&mdash;I'm very tired and I've got
to shave and have a good wash before I go to bed on the
floor next to your friend Ex Corporal Willson on one
side of me and with Galton and Fisher (you have met
Fisher but not Galton&mdash;he is a Scotchman and likes
whiskey hot before going to sleep)&mdash;with Galton and
Fisher kicking me on the other side.</p>

<p>God bless you my dearest little man. Please <i>please</i>
be very good to dear Mummy and your newest Nanny
and please <i>please</i> don't ever spit. I should hate to hear

<p>III&mdash;LETTER TO HIS WIFE ON CHRISTMAS</p>


<div class="right"><span class="smcap">St. Albans</span>, Dec. 26th, 1914.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest</span>,</p>

<p>We have had a terrific Xmas ... tremendous work
and plenty of fun. Went to Midnight Service on Xmas
Eve (special leave being granted from 11 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> to 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to
those wanting to go, and of course I was after anything
going). I know you will forgive me for not writing
more often. We have really been up to our necks in
work&mdash;and an alarum warned us as likely to occur on
Boxing Day ... we were all packed up and ready&mdash;and
indeed one battalion was entrained and another paraded
for entrainment before the "warning" was withdrawn to
<i>us</i> of the 6th Field Ambulance. Perhaps you won't understand
this: it means that the fighting section of the
brigade&mdash;the battalions&mdash;(which of course move off
ahead of us) were not only warned but ordered&mdash;in
other words we were <i>all</i> ordered but <i>our</i> order was
countermanded before taking effect. Hard luck on the
Battalions wasn't it? The 21st had to march 12&frac12; miles
and back for nothing, having been roused at 4 in the
morning to begin with. That is the advantage of belonging
to a unit that travels by "train no. 57" as we do,
instead of one of the first units to go out.</p>

<p>I'm going to turn in. God bless you and my baby&mdash;do
write soon and at length. I know posts are responsible
for it but I haven't had a letter since the one containing
the photos&mdash;for which many thanks&mdash;now four
days ago and I am longing for one.</p>

<p>Bless you! Bless you!</p>

<p>IV&mdash;LETTER TO HIS WIFE ON LANDING IN
FRANCE</p>

<div class="right"><span class="smcap">France</span>, March 18th, 1915.</div>

<p>Here we are in France&mdash;journey not finished yet. We
had an ideal crossing&mdash;and a most amazing one. I believe
every square yard of the Channel has its own
British T.B. Destroyer&mdash;queer black shapes with rectangular
outlines, hard and well drawn against the dark sky
or the streams of light from more distant warships. I
never saw one in detail with the light upon it&mdash;always
in silhouette against the light. We steamed with lights
out nearly all the way. I slept on deck&mdash;not over warm&mdash;but
I kept getting up to see the latest sight as one or
other called me and so kept warm.</p>

<p>We are fed on Bully Beef (ordinary Fray Bentos, you
know the brand) and lovely hard biscuits which I adore.
Last night I added to my menu a bloater and some bread
and marmalade, "duff" and coffee&mdash;having scraped an
acquaintance with some of the engine room artificers who
invited me to sup in the fo'castle. It was very hot in
there but we supped in low neck. Great fun!</p>

<p>Bye bye&mdash;Love to my blessed boy&mdash;Try to read him as
much of my letters as he will understand. I do miss
him so and I want him to hear about me all he can so's
we shan't be strangers when we meet next. Rubbish I
know, but still I'm not quite joking. He's growing so
fast.</p>

<p>An unfortunate officer has got to read this and a hundred
more letters, so I'll cut it short. Bless you.</p>

<p>V&mdash;LETTER TO HIS SON AT THE BATTLE-FRONT</p>


<div class="right"><span class="smcap">France</span>, March 30th, 1915.</div>

<p>Hullo Vallie! I'm in France at the war at last. How
are you? We are having such a funny time all sleeping
on straw on the floor&mdash;think of that when you get into
your little cribbie-cot to-night.</p>

<p>I am sitting writing this on a sack on the ground with
my back against Jack's. You remember Jack the cook?
In front of me are all the horses in rows and rows tied
to pegs driven into the ground. They are tied by the head&mdash;the
way Modestine used to be&mdash;to one peg and by the
hind foot to another peg to prevent them turning round
and kicking each other. They don't like having their
hind foots tied and pull at them and swear with their
ears and top lips. You remember how your Modestine
used to swear with her ears. They try to kick too, just
as she used to do.</p>

<p>There are soldiers all about here, all busy shoving the
Germans back and <i>shoving</i> the Germans back and
SHOVING the Germans back, and sooner or later we
shall shove the whole lot of them right back into Germany
over the Rhine&mdash;which is a big river&mdash;bigger than
the river at Maidenhead&mdash;RIGHT back into Germany
and off their feet, and then we shall sit on their heads
severely until they have had enough, and then the war
will be over, and we shall just have to tidy up and come
home and I shall come home to you my Darling and the
Blessed Mummy and the nice flat at St. John's Wood,
and oh, I do hope it will be soon because I want to see
you and Mummy most awfully.</p>

<p>Good bye my precious, please give my love to Gram
and tell her I wish I could have some English Turkey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
And please Vallie send everybody you can out here to
help shove, because the sooner the Germans are shoved
over and the more of us there are to sit on their heads,
the sooner I shall see you all again.</p>

<p>VI&mdash;LETTER TO HIS WIFE ON NIGHT
REVERIES</p>


<div class="right">April 30th, 1915.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Darling</span>,</p>

<p>Curious situations abound. Behold me sitting in
Lieut. Dickenson's chair by Lieut. Dickenson's fire in the
midst of Lieut. Dickenson's deserted patience (a game
unknown to me: five rows and aces out) Lieut. D. having
gone forth to the Regimental Aid Post on our L.
Front to see a man afflicted suddenly with peritonitis.
We are a party forming an Advance Dressing Station
here at &mdash;&mdash;. We have just sent our first case (Sergeant
shot through chin, tongue and neck&mdash;quite conscious&mdash;hit
at three, remained in trench till seven, left us
8.15&mdash;in Hospital by now) into &mdash;&mdash; together with a request
for two pounds of soda for the Bat. M.O. on our
R. Front. (Thus our Motor Ambulances fetch and
carry). I am waiting up to take the soda when it arrives
up to the M.O. at his aid post behind the trenches. Why
soda in the middle of the night? <i>Gas</i>, my dear. Les
Bosches are now throwing chunks of gas at us. Nasty
smelly trick, isn't it? We are replying in our nice clean
British way with soda&mdash;at least so I thought at first, but
the truth is that partially asphyxiated Tommies thrive on
Sodium <i>Bi</i>&mdash;not the washing variety. I am going to
rouse out Fisher (now sleeping peacefully in the billet in
spite of a battery) to walk up with me when the stuff
arrives. Lieut. Dickenson won't let me go alone. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
lovely night&mdash;high moon almost full and a low mist over
the firing line through which star shells (otherwise
rockets) twinkle up occasionally. The battery near here
"bings" out a shell every ten minutes or so. It is a noisy
brute but some naval guns over a mile away are quite
deafening even at that distance. The expression "tearing
the atmosphere" really applies to the scream of their
shells as they pass overhead. They do sound like tearing
silk heard through a stethoscope. The prettiest
sound of the night is a machine-gun a mile or so to our
right firing short tap tap tap tap taps like an over-grown
woodpecker. Understand that these sounds are only
occasional only the scattered rifle fire being anything like
continuous, and that so scattered that it is a mere background.
Bing! from the near battery&mdash;five minutes
elapse&mdash;tap tap tap tap, another four or five&mdash;tap tap tap
again&mdash;a slight increase in the rifle fire&mdash;<i>Bahang
Wheeeee!</i> from the naval gun&mdash;ten minutes perfect calm
but for rifles very faint and intermittent, tap tap tap&mdash;tap
tap tap. This time from further off: the woodpecker's
mate. Sh Sh Sh&mdash;Sh&mdash;Sh a German shell coming
to <i>look for</i> our Battery. Sh Sh Sh! Whap! Missed
it by about half a mile&mdash;five or six minutes peace. Bing
from ours. Bing again after a minute and two more
bings rapid. Peace once more, the rifles a trifle fainter,
one crack a trifle louder. Tap tap tap tap tap&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>That's half an hour not taken down of course but typified.
I am looking forward to the walk.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;LETTER TO HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW ON
HIS BOY'S FUTURE</p>


<div class="right">May 28th, 1915, Empty Hospital.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Gram</span>,</p>

<p>Thanks very much for your letter. It is now nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
three weeks since it reached me but you will, I am sure,
forgive tardiness in replying: those three weeks have
been so very full of work.</p>

<p>Of course I have no objection to your teaching Vallie
a prayer. Why should I have? Only please teach him
one thing: that his prayer may not be answered and
that if it isn't, he must not think that God is cruel or
unmindful. "Thy will be done" is the safety valve in all
prayer and a believer in God must surely think&mdash;if they
do not say&mdash;those words as a part of every prayer. In
the case of a child I think they should be said.</p>

<p>I would be grateful if you would not muddle his little
brain with trinitarian dogma. I have nothing against
the trinity idea except that it is puzzling and quite unnecessary.
It's all right for an artist or a mystic&mdash;it can
have a symbolic meaning which is most grateful but I
think it should not be taught. One can be a lover of
God without going into the matters of the definition of
Christ; and all such difficulties. If Vallie grows up a
poet or a mystic, he will fight into those problems for
himself. I would rather he had the chance to do so
unguided. If he is going to grow up an engineer or a
farmer, he will be no poorer for never having been troubled
with them.</p>

<p>If I don't come home you may&mdash;I mean: <i>Please will
you</i>&mdash;teach him the Sermon on the Mount and "The
Lord is my Shepherd" etc., but I have always looked forward
to teaching him these myself and still hope to do so&mdash;this
coming winter too.</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;LETTER TO HIS SON ON "SWANKING"</p>

<p>Vallie you villain what's this I hear about your visit
to Brighton? Swanking in the Hotel about having cut
the Kaiser into little bits and put him down the dust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
shoot. <i>Swank</i> Sir, you never did <i>nothink</i> of the sort.
He's still bossing Germany and giving us no end of trouble.
You must have cut up somebody else by mistake.
You really should look before you chop.</p>

<p>Bye bye, my darling little man. I love you most
muchly much. How do you like me?</p>

<p>IV&mdash;LETTER TO HIS DOG&mdash;HEART TO HEART</p>


<div class="right">July 6th, 1915.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Emma</span>,</p>

<p>Do you realise that I haven't written to you <i>once</i> in
four months away? Do you? If you don't, I am hurt,
if you do and <i>don't mind realising it</i> I am still more hurt.
Taken either way you are a heartless little dog and you
don't deserve a letter.</p>

<p>There is only one hope for you. You may be too
proud to enquire with suitable asperity, why I have not
written. I leave it to you, <i>are</i> you proud?</p>

<p>If so what of? Your ears?&mdash;I beg your pardon; I
forgot Firstie. Of course you've a right to be proud
after all, but I don't see your point. Why should your
natural pride in Firstie be too great for you to complain
of my remissness. You are illogical Emma, as well as
heartless. I don't see what you're getting at.</p>

<p>If you see that son of mine, you might give him my
love and tell him to get his hair cut. If it hasn't been
cut since the photo it must be too long by now&mdash;unless it
grows backwards: in which case he must have a knot
tied in each hair close to his blessed little scalp to prevent
it growing in too far and coming out of his chin as
whiskers. Will you see to this? I don't want to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
back and find my little boy sprouting a beard: he's too
young for such things.</p>

<p>Please give my love to Mrs. Chapin with this, letter
<i>enclo</i>. It's a silly sort of letter&mdash;a great mistake I know&mdash;but&mdash;entre
nous&mdash;(that's French) I'm a silly sort of
person and subject to quite idiotic moods when I start
thinking about all my darlings at home in England.</p>

<p>X&mdash;LETTER TO HIS WIFE ON WAR'S HORRORS</p>


<div class="right">July 22nd, 1915.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest</span>,</p>

<p>I am quite incapable of doing justice to this morning's
entertainment. "They" have been shelling the most
thickly&mdash;and poorly&mdash;populated part of this little mining
town. Some of us went up into it getting the wounded
out. Houses, men, women, and children blown to pieces
by huge high explosives&mdash;and more shells coming over
every few minutes, all within a couple of hundred yards
of the hospital. I want to tell you all I see&mdash;all that happens
to me out here, but I must fail to convey it&mdash;and I
don't want you quite to share my feelings. Amazing,
ironic contrasts abounded: within five minutes of each
other came in a self-possessed young woman of about ten
to have the remains of her arm cut off&mdash;perfectly calm&mdash;walked
in&mdash;never cried or showed the least excitement&mdash;<i>and</i>
a man of fifty on a stretcher with a mangled leg who
roared out in an enormous mad voice for his "Maman"
over and over again till he was anæsthetised. Could any
creation of the imagination equal this? Or this scene in
a squalid kitchen:&mdash;a huge woman dead on her face
across the threshold, a little child also dead at her feet,
the legs of her men folk (husband and son?) straggling
across the foot way outside (I am keeping back all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
hundreds of horrible details, hard though it may be to
believe it) and her remaining daughter a child of about
twelve&mdash;leaping back and forth over the bodies struggling
to get a chain from the neck of the body. "Souvenir!"
I tried to get her away&mdash;she was half mad&mdash;but
was assailed fiercely by neighbours on her behalf, who
seemed to regard her desire for a memento of her mother
under the circumstances, most natural and commendable.
While I was being suppressed another shell came over
and we went to earth in a heap, the hundred yards away
crash bringing down plaster and crockery on to our
heads and the flying pieces of "case" buzzing past the
windows like enormous bees or small aeroplanes. When
they had settled the child returned to the chain&mdash;armed
now with a carving knife&mdash;and I left her to it.</p>


<p>XI&mdash;LAST LETTER TO HIS SON&mdash;AT THE
TRENCHES</p>


<div class="right">Sept. 18th, 1915.</div>

<p>My Son-bird, how are you? I'm quite well but a
little stiff in the joints. We've been doing a lot of digging:
making a <i>trench</i> to carry wounded people up and
down, and we've walked miles and miles back from the
place where we did the digging and we are tired.</p>

<p>We are not very near the Germans <i>here</i>, but we can
hear them banging away in the distance sometimes, and
last night all the sky was lit up in their direction by a
big fire&mdash;houses burning. Yesterday&mdash;too&mdash;while we
were up digging near to them some Germans climbed up
a tower behind their lines, and we had to bob down into
the holes we were digging to prevent them seeing us and
then <i>our</i> cannons banged at <i>them</i> and they came down
from the tower in a hurry.</p>

<p>I do hope you are a good little boy. It's so much nicer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to have a good little boy at home than to have a regular
little pickle. Please write and tell me if you are a good
little boy&mdash;I shall be so pleased to hear it.</p>

<p>Love from your Doody.</p>


<p>XII&mdash;LAST LETTER TO HIS WIFE&mdash;AT
DEATH'S DOOR</p>


<div class="right">Sept. 24th, 1915.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sweetheart Mine</span>:</p>

<p>This is my ideal of happiness: (under war conditions)
to arrive back, after a hard day's navvying among the
nice big bangs (I really do like the noise of guns&mdash;unhealthy
taste, eh?) to come back to camp and tea healthily
tired, to come back by the <i>first</i> batch of cars thereby
ensuring a wash unhurried and evading the wait by the
roadside at "&mdash;&mdash;" <i>and</i> to find a letter from you waiting
for me. I am sure you think my effusions over your
letters mere civil romance but they are not. I cannot
exaggerate the pleasure I feel when I wade into a letter
from you.</p>

<p>I am so very glad that you are to have the blessed with
you again. I hate to think of you and him apart. It
makes me feel altogether too "scattered" (compris?)
to have a son here, a wife there, a mother somewhere
else, a sister elsewhere. Keep him with you all you can
and talk to him about me a <i>lot</i>. I do so want to come
home to you both.</p>

<p>We are launching forth in many directions: beds (for
patients of course) and a young drug store under a roof
of its own; no longer housed with the Quarter Master's
store. At present <i>I</i> and some score of others are going
up to the line daily doing the most glorious navvying:
knocking cellars into each other and whitewashing the
whole into operating rooms and waiting rooms, and bearers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
billets; digging special R.A.M.C. stretcher trenches
to connect them (A) with the general communicating
trenches and (B) with each other and filling billions of
sandbags to protect the entrances to these cellar-stations.
I love the work, three days I slaved at a part of the trench
where it traverses a mine-yard and came back a Frank
Tinney at night. Yesterday I was housebreaking with
hammer and chisel or pick connecting up cellars by holes
knocked in walls and making bolting holes to get in and
out through. Also we go investigating the rows and
rows of empty houses (the line where we work passes
almost through a mining townlet now deserted) bagging
chairs, mirrors&mdash;there are many quite good ones unbroken
in the midst of the chaos of bent girders, scattered walls,
roofs, pavements even.</p>

<p>Everybody seems very high-spirited out here and
grumbling is a thing of the past. I suspect that the
weather is reason. Day after day is glorious&mdash;though
night after night is <i>cold</i>.</p>

<p>As the weather grows colder my appetite increases,
<i>cake</i> most acceptable.</p>

<p>Posting this the morning after writing it. Was called
away to interview M. Le Directeur des Mines apropos
d'une affaire forte difficile, <i>je vous dis</i>.</p>

<p>Love to the dear&mdash;I wish I were going to see you both
again soon. Wanted!&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>The above was the last letter ever received from Harold
Chapin. The following unfinished letter was found
in his pocket-book after his death. It was written some
days before the preceding letter.</i>]</p>

<p>XIII&mdash;LAST LETTER TO HIS MOTHER&mdash;AS HE
DIES</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Mater</span>:</p>

<p>I dunno if I did or did not write to you the day after
that letter to Calypso. We've had a good few days lately
when 6 o'clock parade (6 o'clock a.m. you understand)
and dusk were linked up by a day's work and march so
that no letters were written, and I dare swear the censor
was correspondingly rejoiced.</p>

<p>Our days spent trench digging (special communication
trenches we dig, pour chercher les blessées not for
wicked men with arms or what would the Geneva convention
say?), our days spent trench digging are a great
source of enjoyment&mdash;curious, because they involve a
bolted breakfast&mdash;a seven o'clock start, an hour's jog
in a hard, springless, G.S. waggon, a halting, single-file
march of a couple of miles and a day of back breaking
work at pick and shovel followed sometimes by march
and G.S. waggon back, sometimes by a long march and
<i>no</i> G.S. waggon. The secret of their charm is the feeling
of doing something actual compared with the messing
about cleaning waggons for inspection and everlastingly
tidying up camp to get it dirty again. Those
trenches may never be used but if ever it is necessary to
bring in wounded from the fire trenches to the aid posts
under anything of a bombardment they will mean endless
lives saved. It's a pleasant thought. I haven't seen
the Lloyd George speech you mention.&mdash;I didn't know
he'd written anything lately. Do you know&mdash;coeval with
his rise in popularity I am getting a bit sick of him. He
strikes me as being all enthusiasm and no judgment&mdash;no
sense of fitness. On the tide and with the tide of universal
approval is not the best place for a Welshman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
I prefer the "brave man struggling with adversity" to
this popular idol playing with his admirers, being rude
to them just to show how well he can apologise, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Books&mdash;yes, I want a pocket Browning mit everything
in it! Is such a thing to be had, I wonder? Of course
I've got sizable pockets. Still it's a tall order.</p>

<p>Anyway I want "Paracelsus" and "Men and Women"
particularly. I am on guard and writing letters for the
next two or three days (I may only send off one a day).
Our supply of corporals is not quite adequate to the demands
made upon it and this will be my fourth night on
guard in a fortnight.&mdash;Rather fatiguing work, involving
a night of cat naps fully dressed and booted and a final
rise at a little after 4 a.m. to call the cooks and "duties,"
hoist the flag and remove the lamps and finally (at 5
a.m.) to call the camp in general.</p>

<p>Later</p>

<p>(Sunday in fact)</p>

<p>Oh, my dear, I wish you could see your golden-haired
laddie sitting by the roadside waiting for a waggon,&mdash;time
5 p.m.</p>

<p>I have been for two days digging through the slag
heap of a mine! A mine! Our trench happens to go that
way. I am as black as a coal heaver.</p>

I&mdash;STORY OF THE RUSSIAN GENERAL STAFF</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>
<p>One hears a lot in war about the "man behind the
gun," but there is another individual, and a lot of them
just as important, and that is the "man behind" the "man
behind the gun," or, more briefly stated, the one higher
up. I have known scores of Russian generals since the
beginning of the war, and have written a good deal about
the men at the greater staffs who play the intellectual
end of the game in their distant offices, but, I think, far
too little of the generals who sit in rough peasant cottages
at the front, just behind the lines where the roar
of the artillery and the rattle of the machine gun tells
them of their troops in action even before the field telephone
buzzes through its raucous message from the
trenches. I spent June 23d (1915) with a division commander
who may be taken as the type of scores of others
who are directing the tactics of the war to-day. And
when I write of General Monkevitch I write, I think, of
many more who are almost identical in character and
mould. This General I call my "Russian godfather,"
because he was the first one I met when I came to
Russia, and it was he who, sitting in a luxurious office
in Petrograd in September, 1914, arranged the first permits
that enabled me to join the army in the field. In
those days he was an important member of the Petrograd
General Staff and with his smart uniform and silver
<i>aiguillettes</i> with his resplendent shoulder straps he was a
picture of a city officer. Even in that early day he bemoaned
his fate at being detained on staff work at the
distant capital when the real work was going on at the
front. When I came back from my first trip I was told
that my friend had gone to the front "somewhere in
Bukovina," and gradually the recollection of his kindly
features drifted back among the memories of the past.</p>

<p>That afternoon I was ushered into the low-ceilinged
room of a humble peasant's cottage, where a tired-looking
man in war-worn uniform, tarnished shoulder straps,
and muddy boots, was leaning over a hand-hewn table
strewn with maps. He looked up as we entered, and I
discovered in the commander of the division my erstwhile
friend of Petrograd. Half of the house was still
occupied by the peasants, while the General's sleeping
apartment was in a rough shack outside, where he slept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
on a camp bed, with hardly any adornment in the room
save a low bench on which was placed a battered old tin
basin, if one may call it an ornament.</p>

<p>"The luxurious establishment of a Russian General
of Division," he told me laughingly as he showed me over
his place of residence. In the trellised vestibule of the
cottage were the telephones and telegraphs, while from
all directions came the field wires from the positions six
versts beyond.</p>

<p>Sitting round the rough table, we listened to the General's
account of his divisions fighting against the advance,
an achievement that I have already alluded to in a
previous chapter, and then, at his advice, we paid a visit
to the front, as I have also mentioned elsewhere. The
generals higher up are so far away that it is only by
chance that they see their men or come in actual contact
with their wounded. These divisional commanders are
the ones that stand between the intellectual end of the
game and the men in the trenches. The moment a shot
is fired unexpectedly, their telephone from the trenches
tells them what is the cause. An hour after a fight starts,
the wounded (if the positions be near) begin to drift
back here. In this headquarters the General could look
out of the window and see the price in human suffering
that the plans he made on the map before him were costing
Russia....</p>

<p>After dinner I accompanied General Monkevitch on a
walk about the town. With a long, swinging gait he
paced down the primitive little street, with a nod and a
word for every soldier that he passed. With scrupulous
courtesy he returned the bows of the peasants who smilingly
greeted him, for it was easy to see that he was a
favourite in the village. Even the little children came in
for a pleasant word and a bit of chaff, and several times
he stopped with his officers about him to joke with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
kiddies, and the littler they were the more happily they
responded to his pleasant words.</p>

<p>A bit down the street we turned into the great shed
where first come the wounded from the smaller units of
the divisions. Yesterday, the General told us, his face
suddenly going very sad, had resulted in heavy losses.
For a moment he stood in a reverie, and then, throwing
off his mood of melancholy, shrugged his shoulders and
said: "Well, let us look at those within."</p>


<p>II&mdash;TALES OF THE WOUNDED RUSSIAN
SOLDIERS</p>

<p>The great wooden shed was divided into a series of
rooms where clean, sweet-smelling hay and new-cut
clover was piled deeply on the floor, and here lay those
too heavily wounded to be moved immediately to the
rear. All told, there remained but a few hundred, the
great bulk, as the General told me, having been cleared
within eight hours after their arrival, to be sent to the
greater bases where more comforts awaited them. Between
the double rows of haggard creatures slowly strode
the General, stopping every few paces to speak to the
wounded. The relation of the Russian peasant to his
superiors is extraordinary. Never is there the slightest
degree of self-consciousness or embarrassment on the
part of the soldiers, no matter how high or exalted be the
rank of the officer who addresses him.</p>

<p>Again and again soldiers whose haggard features and
glazing eyes denoted the serious nature of their wounds
called to him in faltering voices: "How goes the fight,
Excellency?" or "Did we take the trench, my General?"
And always he would stop and reply, "All goes well, my
children. You have done superbly. I am proud of you.
Go back now to the rear and get well. You have behaved
like heroes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Another groaned audibly as he raised himself to ask:
"Have more of my brothers fallen than of the Austrians?"
The General replied quickly, raising his voice
that all might hear: "For each one of you here, my
children, there are five Austrians to pay for it, so rest
contented that you have done your duty well."</p>

<p>One mere stripling, shot through the stomach, called
to his Chief: "I did my best, Excellency. I killed all I
could," and then sank back, groaning, on his bed of straw.
And thus it went as we entered building after building
where lay the price of victory. One heavily wounded lad
called to the General, who immediately went to his side
and listened to the high, feverish voice tell of the assault,
of capture, escape, and a bullet through the abdomen.
With the quick compassion characteristic of the Russians,
the General reached for his cigarette case and turned its
contents out into the hands of the soldier.</p>

<p>Among the wounded were numbers of Austrians, with
pallid features, lying side by side with the Russians, receiving
the same kind words and gentle treatment that
are accorded to the Russians themselves.</p>

<p>During these assaults many of the wounds are from
machine-gun bullets, and a large portion of such are
through the stomach or abdomen. Many, I think, of such
must die on the battlefield, for of those that die in the
hospitals later the bulk are of such a nature. Certainly
they are hideously painful, and the little murmuring sobs
of the soldiers trying to stifle their anguish are sad indeed
to hear.</p>

<p>Outside under the trees was a row of stretchers, each
reverently covered with a white sheet. The General
halted for a moment, as he uncovered his head. "Our
dead," he murmured reverently, and then briskly, "Shall
we move on?"</p>

<p>And thus, in the wonderful afterglow of a hot summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
day, we strolled with him and beheld the man in his
changing moods&mdash;General, father of his soldiers, mourner
for his dead&mdash;each phase merging and emerging from
the other as the different sights we saw brought them
out. As we wandered casually homeward toward his
quarters we passed a house before which stood a sentry.
It appeared that he was guarding an Austrian captive
officer. Instantly the General turned in and, entering
the tiny peasant room, greeted the officer, who proved
to be a mere boy, in the uniform of the lowest grade of
commissioned officer. The General shook him by the
hand, chatted with him for a minute or two, and then
again shaking hands and saluting, said in German:
"<i>Wohl, auf wiedersehen, mein Freund. Glücklicher
Reise</i>," and left the Austrian standing in the dim twilight,
with a look of wonder on his face. I daresay the
Germans never told him that the Russian officers were
like this.</p>


<p>III&mdash;ALONG THE BATTLE ROAD&mdash;WITH THE
VICTORIOUS</p>

<p>The first dull gray tinge of a misty morning was in
our cottage room when we rolled out of our straw beds
next day. A plodding soldier sleepily rubbing his eyes
gave us a bit of bread and some hot soup, and we were
ready for the day's work. Around at the staff of the
corps we met the Chief of Staff in slippers and without
collar, standing in the door looking dreamily across the
hazy landscape. He smiled genially when he saw us as
he announced that our infantry had already attacked and
carried the first line of the Austrian trenches on the
front of his corps. Away to the west came the heavy
booming of guns, muffled as in cotton by the moisture that
still hung in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>As we talked the General in command stepped out of
his room as brisk and dapper as though he had had a
night's sleep (which he hadn't). His face was wreathed
in smiles as he pulled on his gloves and, lighting a cigarette,
stepped out onto the verandah before which stood
his motor. A moment later we started, and winding
our way out of the little muddy village, we were soon
in among the rolling billows of hills that stretch in great
sweeps in this section of the country.... Though the
hour was early the whole countryside, now saturated
with the life of the army, was beginning to move. In
every grove artillery ammunition parks were packing up,
and already caissons were pulling out on to the roads to
overtake their parent batteries which already had left
their positions of the night before and were pushing
closer to the retiring Austrians, who had succeeded in
escaping from their first line of trenches.</p>

<p>Every village through which we passed was crowded
with reserves getting on the march to be within easy call
of the front, in case the enemy made a counter-attack
against the troops that had been fighting and winning
during the night. With each mile of our advance the
signs of life and activity became more numerous. But
as we pushed with our motors through the mud we soon
began to encounter the back-wash from the battlefield.</p>

<p>First one met a weary, mud-stained soldier with a red,
dripping bandage around one hand which he nursed tenderly
with his other. He was the vanguard of the column
that from now on we passed for an hour. Next came
groups of those wounded so slightly that they could still
walk to the rear. That is, those with minor head and
arm hits, which represent but a few weeks or even days
out of the firing line. Behind these came the creaking
peasant carts, each with its pair of tiny horses tugging
along through the mud and ruts of the roads, and each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
loaded with wounded. Some held six or eight men that
were able to sit up. All had only the first-aid bandages
and most of them were deep-stained with the blood that
oozed through the hastily bound dressing. The attack
had been made in the pouring rain, through a marsh, and
every soldier was saturated with mud, and their faces,
what with dirt and the pain of their wounds, looked in
the early morning light to be the shade of putty.</p>

<p>Next, one began to encounter the carts of heavily
wounded, two in a cart lying on the straw, their eyes
staring up into the misty morning sky, their expressions
indifferent, stolid, and unemotional. Some clung to the
sides of the carts to ease the jolting caused by the inequality
of the way. Others lay as though dead, with
blankets thrown over their faces. These sights, however,
have become as common now as the mud of the road itself
and hardly warrant description.</p>

<p>Now, intermingled among the carts, began to appear a
sprinkling of the blue-coated Austrians, wandering aimlessly
along in the general direction of the flow of traffic.
Sometimes a Russian guard plodded along behind them,
but more often they came quite alone. Some that were
slightly wounded sat beside the road, looking at us with
stupid, heavy eyes as we passed in the motor. All, even
as the Russian soldiers, were plastered with mud and
many saturated with gore, either their own or that of
comrades they had tried to help.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;CAISSONS! HORSES! MEN!&mdash;DRAMA OF
THE BATTLEFIELD</p>

<p>With every verst we moved forward the denser became
the traffic, and now the flow to the rear was as
heavy in volume as that going forward. Caissons that
had sat beside their guns all night feeding them the shells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
that had breached the Austrian lines came toiling back
through the deep-cut roads, the horses steaming and
sweating with their exertions and the mud-plastered
drivers giving them the leash and forcing them into a trot
whenever it was possible to get the empty caissons over
the road more speedily.</p>

<p>One never realized what a number of characters it
takes to make up the great drama behind a battlefield.
It would be possible to sit beside the way for an hour
and write a volume of the strange and curious things one
sees. Here a cartload of peasants that are still pushing
to the rear, unconscious, perhaps, that the battle has
already gone in the opposite direction. Just beyond lie
the smoking embers of the village we saw blazing last
night. There is hardly a chimney standing, and soon the
roads will obliterate even the site of a group of what
but last night was a dozen thatched peasant cottages. I
noticed in the throng a Russian soldier leading a pack
horse still in the Austrian harness with the quaint blinkers
that the enemy use on many of their transport horses.
The poor patient beast had been shot through the nose,
and little rivulets of blood streamed down his velvety
cheek as with plodding steps he followed the soldier who
was leading him. No doubt he would be patched up
again. Certainly that was the intention of the kindly
peasant who now and anon looked back with a gently
murmured word of encouragement to his dumb and
stricken friend and prisoner. The road is narrow at
that part, and we slowed down or took the side again and
again to let ambulances or carts of wounded pass us.</p>

<p>The General called out to the passersby, wishing them
good morning, or occasionally stopped to inquire of a
soldier where he was during the night or how he received
his wound. There is an extraordinary spirit of comradeship
between them, all these Russians, as I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
mentioned many times in my records of this front.</p>

<p>The General stopped his car and in a few minutes was
receiving news of the action from his Chief of Staff,
whom we left back at &mdash;&mdash;. He listened intently, and
then snapped back some directions, and we pushed on
out of the village on to another crest. Here we met a
general of cavalry with an orderly at his heels, both
incrusted with mud and dripping with wet from the
brush through which they had been riding across country.
Spurring his hesitant horse up to the side of the motor,
he shook hands with his commander and told him gleefully
that the prisoners would run into the thousands
and that already six guns were in our hands. As he
backed away, saluting, he narrowly escaped collision with
four stolid soldiers carrying a dead man on a stretcher
elevated above their shoulders. "Why this pains with a
dead man?" one wondered. "War is for the living and
not the dead. Most of them lie where they fall, until
buried." But we were on the move again, coming nearer
and ever nearer to the guns.... We are now surrounded
by columns of unwounded Austrian prisoners
winding back in droves that take up a mile at a time on
the road. Turning a bit off the narrow ribbon we have
been following, we motor up on to another crest, where
is the Commander of the Division and his staff. Here
is the observation point of a battalion, neatly dug out
of the ridge, and men now stroll about casually in the
place where it would have been instant death to show
one's head four hours ago....</p>


<p>V&mdash;HIGH SPIRITS OF THE RUSSIAN TROOPS</p>

<p>The Commander of the Division, whom I knew last
year at Warsaw, told gleefully of the prowess of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
troops and pointed with riding-crop to the point beneath
us where his men forced the river and broke the Austrian
line. Everybody was in high spirits and congratulations
were exchanged between the General and his
officers. In a near-by wheat field were a couple of hundred
blue-coated prisoners, waiting for guides to take
them to the rear, while a hundred yards away were
fifty sour-looking Germans, also waiting developments....</p>

<p>An approaching shell sang through the air and a big
six-inch German shell landed in the field a few hundred
yards away, throwing up clouds of dirt and heavy volumes
of the greasy black smoke of the German high-explosive
shell. Every one was surprised, but no one
even mentioned it. I suppose it is bad taste to allude to
such things.... I must say, however, that these events
do not bother the Russians in the least. Nowadays generals
in high command are constantly going to the positions
and studying out the situation personally, regardless
of risks.</p>

<p>After a dozen shells the firing ceased, but suddenly
broke out again on a farther ridge where I suppose some
observer thought he saw something moving. The General
himself sat quietly down on the crest of the trench
and with map spread out on his lap began to dictate
orders to an orderly who, crouching at his feet, transmitted
them through the field telephone. Here one saw
the real control of a battle. Over the ridge there our
infantry was pushing forward, each regiment unrolling
behind it its field wire and every unit constantly in touch
with this man lying in the wheat field who with finger
on map was directing the following up of the retreating
enemy. Wherever one could see a road it was black
with traffic moving forward, and wherever one looked
over the ridges beyond us one saw the puff of shrapnel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and heard the boom and reverberations of our heavy
guns and the sullen report of bursting German shells.
The map with its many blue and red lines was the key
to the puzzle of sound, and the streams of men and
horses moving in every direction. This one individual
quietly smoking his cigarette on the hilltop, quite unperturbed
by bursting shells, could by a single word divert
or halt all of those endless columns that we saw. Truly
is war a great and fascinating game for those whose
post is not in the trenches. As for them&mdash;well, war is
war.</p>

I&mdash;PARIS&mdash;ON THE EVE OF "INEVITABLE
WAR"</p>

<p><i>July, 1914.</i>&mdash;I have just spent a week in Paris waiting
for my son, who has been doing his three weeks' training
on the frontier at Belfort. I am horrified at the rumors
of war which are in the air. Not that I shrink from
pain, for both my father and brother were soldiers. On
my father's side I am of Lorraine. Every reason, therefore,
to be vigorous, and love my country with all my
might; but I am so afraid that my son will not have time
to finish his military training before the crisis comes, and
that I shall not see him again before the war&mdash;if there is
a war. This idea preys on me day and night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet they say that this war which everyone loathes
is inevitable! Are butchery, frightfulness, pillage, and
destruction inevitable?</p>

<p>It is incredible that well on in the twentieth century,
with civilization at its height, such monstrous iniquity
should be considered "inevitable."</p>

<p>I have spent this week of waiting in Paris, where the
feeling of feverish agitation which precedes great disasters
pervades everything. The shops refuse to sell anything
because they are afraid of not being able to get
in fresh stock later on, everyone refuses notes, and will
only take cash. The banks will give no change, and one
rushes wildly about all over the place with notes for a
thousand or a hundred francs in one's pocket, without
being able to buy a single thing. During all this week
I have been conscious of the mutterings of panic like the
first rumbling of the thunder which precedes a great
storm. I stay at home the whole time waiting for a
wire to tell me that Paul was returning.</p>


<p>II&mdash;A MOTHER&mdash;AND HER SOLDIER SON</p>

<p><i>July.</i>&mdash;I was on the balcony about two o'clock when a
car stopped in front of the house. A sapper got out of it.
I uttered a cry of jubilation&mdash;it was Paul! He came up
and threw himself into my arms. I remained riveted to
the spot, speechless and in tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother, Mother, I did so want to see you before
the great upheaval. What luck! Well, I've seen you,
and now I am ready to go when the bugle calls."</p>

<p>I could not speak; I was choking. I looked at this
dear, big, handsome boy who is my only child, my whole
life, whom I must give to France, must sacrifice perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to the inexorable laws of war. I felt my heart rise
in revolt. I did not say anything, however, for he would
have scolded me and it would have depressed him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>July.</i>&mdash;Yesterday, when we were dining together, the
telephone-bell rang. We both ran to it. It was a call
from the Maison B.</p>

<p>"Is F. there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ask him to come to the telephone at once."</p>

<p>I handed the receiver to my son, and saw that he was
listening gravely and attentively. Then his face lighted
up; he answered, and I guessed part of what was being
said to him. I asked him:</p>

<p>"Is that B.?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother; he is asking me to join a squadron of
the Flying Corps. Six aeroplanes are to be taken to D.;
when I get there I shall be given a commission. You
see, I can't refuse."</p>

<p>"Yes, but before that what did he say to you&mdash;when
you looked so serious? There is going to be war, isn't
there?"</p>

<p>He pursed up his mouth, which is a familiar trick of
his when he wishes to hide something from me.</p>

<p>"My dear Mother, you think everything points to war.
It is quite possible that there will be war, in fact it's almost
certain, but as long as they are not actually on the
frontier and it is not declared, don't take such a jaundiced
view of things, for goodness' sake. B. asks me to go to
Douai to make some trial flights, that's all. I gave up
flying because there were no openings for civilians, and
I had met with endless disappointments and mortifications
at the hands of those who should have helped and
encouraged me. Now these same people have sent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
me; my country needs me, I'm going into the Flying
Corps, and I'm off. Cheer up! be pleased about it. I
am so pleased to be going to be a bird again! Pack up
my things, because I must be at Douai by three o'clock
to-morrow. And don't worry&mdash;the English and the Russians
are in with us. What a lark!"</p>

<p>And I thought: Alas! a poor sort of lark.</p>


<p>III&mdash;TO-MORROW&mdash;WAR WILL BE DECLARED</p>

<p><i>July.</i>&mdash;Paul has gone, and I had scarcely time to dry
my eyes when I received his call to the colors, ordering
him to go to Belfort as a member of the Flying Corps.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And I thought of Drumont, whom I had left at Les
Sablons and was to have rejoined that evening. Could
I leave him alone any longer? What a torture it was to
be divided between one's husband and one's child!</p>

<p>The telephone-bell rang. It was a friend ringing up
from Paris who said:</p>

<p>"Go off at once to join your husband. To-morrow war
will be declared...."</p>

<p>I was in despair and did not know what to do. I felt
that my son might arrive at any minute, and that I might
have gone and not be there to say good-bye to him. And
this time I should be leaving Paris for good and all.</p>

<p>To have to leave Paris, the center of everything, and
not to see Paul again because duty calls me back to the
country&mdash;my God, how cruel it is! The car will take
me back to Les Sablons to-night.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;VISION OF A FRENCH WOMAN'S HEART</p>

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;The mobilization order came out yesterday,
just as I was leaving Paris to join D. at Les Sablons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>The sight of the excitement in the villages, the women
in tears standing spellbound before the tricolor notices,
the mobilized men trudging off with their knapsacks and
any sort of uniform, and young fellows singing the Marseillaise,
upset me terribly.</p>

<p>On this scene of desolation the sun shone gloriously,
indifferent to the troubles of earth, and his rays even
penetrated into the car and reached me as I sat huddled
up in the corner, crying bitterly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;The torture has begun. Yesterday evening
D. was waiting for me when I arrived&mdash;knowing how
upset I should be after parting with my son, he was
anxious and sympathetic. We were both crying when
we kissed each other.</p>

<p>Already we are without papers and without news. We
rush after people who pass reading odd sheets, bought
in neighboring towns and full of vague rumors which
are generally contradicted next day. My chauffeur has
gone, and my staff of servants is reduced to my Hindu
and a charwoman. We often have a good cry together
when we think of the beautiful country we lived in of
yore, and are terrified at the thought of what may be
in store for us here.</p>


<p>V&mdash;THE STREAM TOWARD DEATH</p>

<p>I am still without any news of Paul, and enduring
the misery of not knowing where he is.</p>

<p>I particularly asked a soldier who was starting for
Dijon to find out if F., the airman, was there. But will
he do it?</p>

<p>The road to Fontainebleau passes this house, and all
day long troops and horses go by, and men who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
been called up and are joining their regiments, and cars
bringing back others from their holidays to go to the
front.</p>

<p>And already there is fighting on the frontier. Germany,
like an octopus, has put out her tentacles to wrest
from us our sons, our husbands, and our country. How
monstrous a thing is war! I could not, if I would, describe
my thoughts and feelings, and who would dare
to do so in the midst of such desolation!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The continuous stream flows out towards death&mdash;soldiers
pass singing and shouting, "To Berlin!" Others
go by in silence, fierce-looking, and determined.</p>

<p>The women make superhuman efforts not to cry as
they accompany them to the stations. Everything is well
organized. Yesterday thirty trains went through at intervals
of five minutes, all full of young men. Fontainebleau
is in a ferment, so is Paris; they say that the principal
hospital will be at Fontainebleau, and a whole nursing
staff is being organized to attend to the first wounded
who come in. A great many officers' wives have volunteered
as nurses. They have put up hospital tents all
round the station at Moret.</p>

<p>This morning I at last received news of my darling son.
Alas! he has apparently been sent to Belfort. It seems
the irony of fate that he who is so madly keen on aeroplanes
should be sent to look after balloons, in which
he takes no interest. However, Paul is brave and energetic,
he is also fortunately devoid of the sort of recklessness
which leads people to expose themselves uselessly.
Drumont said to me the other day: "The sound
common sense he inherits from you will be worth a fortune
to him."</p>

<p>My dear boy's letter has stirred me to the very depths
of my being. Day or night I will never part with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
lock of his hair which we cut off just as he was going.</p>

<p>Since six o'clock this morning there has been an unending
stream of horses and carts which have been mobilized.
With incredible insolence the Germans have
crossed the frontier before declaring war. Near Belfort
they have rounded up all the cattle. Their plan
seems to be a sudden shattering attack which will cause
a panic and bring the half-finished mobilization to a
standstill.</p>

<p>I sat in a brown study brooding over all this news,
whilst poor old Black, upset by his young master's absence,
wandered forlornly round me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;An anxious letter from Muncho&mdash;what an
affectionate little thing she is, and she really does love
my son, "our Paul," as she calls him. He has written
to her, and she is delighted, though it is a delight largely
mingled with pain.</p>

<p>I find on analyzing my feelings for my future daughter-in-law
that I am not at all jealous of her, or afraid
of any paltry rivalry between us in my son's affections.
On the contrary, it seems to me that when there are two
people to love him so much it should be a sort of protection
to him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;Belgium is putting up a heroic defence&mdash;what
a debt we shall owe to her! What a hero her King
is, and what a fine race of men! They are amazing us
by their serenity under the most crushing and undeserved
misfortunes, and the way in which, at a word from their
sovereign, they are sacrificing themselves for the cause
they believe to be right. Our gratitude must be as great
as our admiration, and we shall not forget Mr. Asquith's
pledge on behalf of the Allies never to sheathe the sword<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
while a German remains in Belgium. We, the mothers
of France, offer to their noble Queen, who does her duty
with such dignity and simplicity, our homage and our
boundless gratitude, a gratitude proportionate to the
greatness of her sacrifice.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;A SOLDIER'S SOUL&mdash;THE SPIRIT OF
FRANCE</p>

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;I have had a letter from Belfort from my
son telling me that it had taken him seventeen hours to
get from Paris to Belfort. There was indescribable enthusiasm
in every place he passed through. The women
were crying and laughing at the same time, as if they
were mad, climbing up to the doors and decorating them
with flowers, kissing the soldiers and filling the carriages
with food and cigarettes. On all sides there were
cheering and bravoes and cries of "<i>à bas l'Allemagne</i>,"
and "<i>Vive la France</i>"&mdash;in fact such scenes of enthusiasm
as stimulate courage and awaken patriotism in hearts in
which they seemed to be numb.</p>

<p>And now, after this long, exciting journey, Paul is
alone in Belfort, with nothing to do but to guard the
balloons, when all the time he is dying to be in the fighting
round the town. He says, "Sometimes the thought
of you and of Her seems to hover over me like two great
white birds on a dark plain. It is painful but exquisitely
sweet, and I drive away these two birds because they
unman me."</p>

<p>Ah! my dear son, what a sorrow parting with you is!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yesterday evening, as I was leaning out of my window,
I heard a train passing, and soldiers shouting "To
Berlin." Ah! God grant that they may get there! and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
cried as I thought of my son: Where is he? Why can't
he write to me? Is he still at the aerodrome?</p>

<p>This morning the butcher said to me, "There is no
more beef or mutton, we have only got veal." All the
better; I wish we did not have to eat at all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yesterday, as I was going to bed, about ten o'clock,
one of these trains was passing down the valley. The
effect was striking: I could scarcely see the carriages,
there were so few lights in the train, but a plaintive sort
of melody was issuing from one of them. The unending
line of vans full of soldiers playing the tunes of their
country as they go to their death, above them a blood-red
crescent moon&mdash;it was a terrible and unforgetable
sight. I shall never forget that phantom train.</p>

<p>Oh, my son! where are you?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We spent the day at the station serving out food and
drink to the soldiers traveling to Paris and then on
North. They were all so happy, singing and laughing
and promising to bring us the Kaiser's head.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;STORIES OF REFUGEES&mdash;FLEEING FROM
THE SAVAGE HORDE</p>

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;Four days have gone by without anything interesting
happening. The great battle is still impending.
The Germans are as savage as ever, and news of my
son comes very seldom. Fortunately his little fiancée
writes to me, and her letters reach me, as they have not
so far to come. These dear children lavish so much
affection on me and are always assuring me how certain
they are that we shall win.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>M. C. saw at Dinant a lieutenant who had got hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of a machine-gun, and was mowing down the Germans
who were appearing in fours on the summit of a hill. It
required an order from a superior officer to bring that
lieutenant back. He remained there alone, without thinking
of the danger, and only retired when, tired of arguing,
they told him, "Well, if you don't care about your
life, we do care about the loss of a machine-gun."</p>

<p>Every moment one comes across similar acts of heroism.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;Paul has written to me; I have his letter
here. It is just like him, brave boy! Oh, I am sure that
he will come back to me!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Old prophecies are being re-published proclaiming the
fall of the German Empire. People gather together to
read them aloud, and pass them on to their neighbors,
like so many thirsty travelers happening on a spring of
fresh water.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! To see the last Prussian at his last gasp,
and all due to us. What a glorious sight!" That is what
we are all saying to each other in France.</p>

<p>These hordes of barbarians who rob the dead, kill the
wounded, and fire on our ambulances; who shoot old
men, women, and children, and girls when they have violated
them; who cut off little boys' hands, so that they
shall not fight against them later on&mdash;these monsters who
have escaped from Hell will return thither or else there
is no Divine justice.</p>

<p>The news of the atrocities committed in Belgium by
the Kaiser's monsters emptied the villages in the North
in a single night, and one can imagine nothing more
dismal than the stream of fugitives along the roads of
France. We saw them passing by our houses, coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
from goodness knows where, piled up on carts with their
animals, their bedding, their old men and their children,
and all their household goods.</p>

<p>They had come through Paris, their horses almost
dropping with fatigue, to seek a refuge in some friendly
district, but where that would be they knew not. For
the moment their only idea was to go a long, long way
off to the other ends of the earth, in order to escape
from the blood-thirsty hordes.</p>

<p>From the North right down to the South of France
the roads were covered with thousands of panic-stricken
refugees, in carts, in cars, in carriages, in trains, all in
the wildest confusion. Many of them camped out all
night, in their carts, and quite near the house there were
some whom we tried to help a little. The stories they
told led us also to think of flight.</p>

<p>One night the soldiers from the depot at Fontainebleau
passed under our windows, going in the direction
of Provins. An officer who is a great friend of ours had
said to us, "When you see the soldiers from the depot
going&mdash;go too." It was terrible.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful moonlight night, the regiment in
extended formation marched along the Avenue des Sablons.
Their measured tread purposely muffled, the slight
rattling of their mess-tins against their haversacks, and
from time to time a curt command given in a low voice,
threw us into an agony of fear. We could not sleep:
and hidden behind the Venetian blinds we and our maid
spent the night in watching them.</p>

<p>We had tried to give the soldiers drinks, but the officers
objected. I thought of all the mothers whose sons were
marching through that tragic night to death, while they,
poor women, were sleeping or peacefully praying for
them in some far-off corner of France. I thought of my
own boy, and my heart was wrung with anguish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>When day came I went to lie down, feeling crushed,
all my courage gone.</p>

<p>The next day the Mayor sent to say that we ought to
go; an enemy force was at Provins; the Germans were
advancing rapidly; communications would be cut by them,
and it would be wisest to be off.</p>

<p>I could not make up my mind to it, although all these
stories filled me with terror, and Paul said in every letter,
"For Heaven's sake&mdash;go!" I still shrank from the
pang of leaving my house and all that was in it, and especially
my animals, my dogs, my mementoes, all the links
that bind one to one's home.</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;STORY OF THE FLIGHT BEFORE THE
INVADERS</p>

<p>The journey, which generally takes two hours, lasted
for ten. We were packed like sardines. There were all
sorts of things in our carriage, from a baby's bath to a
birdcage. Oh! how often we stopped between the stations!
(We heard afterwards that there had been an
accident on a side line, which accounted for the block
and the impossibility of getting on.) The passengers
kept getting out and sitting on the banks, and the children
played about and amused themselves.</p>

<p>Trains full of soldiers, and even of wounded, were
hung up like us on parallel lines. All this confusion
brought home to one the panic and terror of this herd
of human beings who, in order to escape from the enemy,
were rushing headlong into inconceivable troubles.</p>

<p>On the edge of the forest of Orleans we stopped for
more than an hour. By this time it was night, but the
moon was shining. Another train had also drawn up,
and in the moonlight, the two trains looked like long
funeral processions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>The Master had not spoken since we left. With my
face in my hands I was crying, and there was complete
silence in the compartment. All of a sudden the most
exquisite song rose on the tragic night. The voice came
from the other train which had been stopped like ours
near the forest. It was a man's voice, and he sang the
serenade from "<i>La Damnation de Faust</i>"&mdash;"<i>Vous qui
faites l'endormie</i>," etc., and this song, rendered with feeling
by a musical and charming voice, lifted my spirits
from gloom and my soul from despair.</p>

<p>How I listened to this song, which bore from the
train-load of wounded the sweet message of a loving
thought to some far-away sweetheart. In the moonlight
in the midst of all this human misery and distress it was
sublime.</p>

<p>Oh! love, thou art within the reach of all, and like the
great sea sheddest thy glamor even within the lowliest
dwelling.</p>

<p>I shall long remember that man's song, and his warm
and vibrant southern voice.</p>

<p>These poetic impressions were soon obliterated at
Orleans. Never shall I forget the hell that station
was.... It seemed impossible to walk through that station
without treading upon something or somebody.
Hundreds of human beings were stretched on seats and
on the ground; children were sleeping amongst bits of
orange-peel and dirty pieces of paper, their mothers were
squatting down beside them. Stretcher-bearers were going
round with their stretchers.</p>

<p>All of us conceal from our neighbors our inmost
thoughts, our secret wounds, our hidden dreams, our
cherished illusions, and our unknown longings. And the
part of us which we hide so jealously is the most real,
the most essential, the most enduring. That which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
offer to the outer world is only the husk and the mask!</p>

<p>Ah! what we mothers hide!</p>

<p>Yesterday at Lamballe we met a convoy of Prussian
prisoners. They were going, under a strong guard, to
work on the railway. At the sight of the gang my heart
leapt within me. Standing up in the car I lost all control
of myself, and shouted: "Bandits, savages, assassins,
down with the Kaiser!" I was trembling with rage and
emotion to think that here I had before my eyes those
brutes who had killed women and children, girls and old
men, for no reason at all&mdash;simply for the pleasure of
killing.</p>

<p>My friends were as much moved as I was, and even
after the prisoners had passed we kept on shouting, "<i>A
bas l'Allemagne</i>," and "<i>Vive la France!</i>"</p>

<p>They marched by, unmoved, with a contemptuous and
disdainful expression on their brutal faces. Only a very
few of them looked as if they came from a decent class&mdash;the
rest were savages. Really, when one is near them,
one feels a regular surge of hate.</p>


<p>IX&mdash;THE BREAKING HEARTS OF THE
MOTHERS OF FRANCE</p>

<p><i>December 31.</i>&mdash;The wintry wind is blowing keenly and
violently. The year is dying, and I am thinking of those
out there in the trenches who are playing at "<i>Qui perd
gagne</i>." How sorrowfully they must be thinking of their
loved ones! and I am thinking also of the unutterable
sadness of everything around my son.</p>

<p>The pagans used to sprinkle lustral waters on towns
defiled by inexpiable wars, to appease the anger of the
gods. Who can tell us what ritual we can perform to
allay the anger of God and wipe out the traces of so much
blood?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>What is my son doing on this last evening of the year,
on this December 31st which soon will be torn from this
year's calendar like the last leaf from a tree that thenceforward
remains black and withered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The papers are full of stories of German atrocities.
The naked bodies of some women were found stripped
and empaled on German bayonets near a farm, their
breasts had been cut in pieces, and other unspeakable
details revealed the Sadism which prevails among the
Kaiser's soldiers. Is his madness infectious? and has
it spread to his Army?&mdash;or are these massacres due to
the brutes being drunk? A Red Cross nurse who had
looked after a wounded prisoner, an officer, was warmly
thanked by him several times. His thanks were charmingly
expressed in excellent French. He even went so
far as to promise to send her a little souvenir when he
went back to his country. Soon afterwards, when he
had recovered, he did go back, and the nurse thought no
more about it, until one day she received a parcel from
the German officer.</p>

<p>Rather surprised at so much politeness she eagerly
undid the parcel, and nearly fainted with horror on discovering,
wrapped up in tissue-papers, two baby's hands
cut off at the wrist. Such monstrous behavior seems inconceivable
on the part of a man of a certain class, and
therefore better educated than the mass of common soldiers.
A story like this sets one thinking of the mother
who must have been present when her child was mutilated....</p>

<p>Who will ever know all the sufferings endured by
Frenchwomen in these hours of terror and death brought
upon them by the German war? They, too, have trodden
the road to Calvary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Surely this Kaiser must be the Anti-Christ, for he has
destroyed the foundations of the old world and overthrown
the pillars of modern society, and all the laws
of humanity and of Christian morality. Surely the hand
of God will weigh heavy upon him!</p>

<p>(This French mother describes heroically her experiences
in Paris and at Les Sablons, with her flight to
Val André, and then thanks God from the bottom of her
heart that she is the "mother of Paul" and has lived in
these heroic days.)</p>

<h2>"THE FALL OF TSINGTAU"&mdash;THE
WAR IN THE FAR EAST</h2>

<div class="center"><i>With the Japanese in the Orient</i><br />
<br />
<i>Told by Jefferson Jones, an American Civilian Eye
Witness</i>
</div>


<blockquote>

<p>This American witnessed the epoch-making events in the Far
East, within the lines of the Japanese Army, through a permit
granted by General Kamio, Commander of the Allied Forces at
Tsingtau. He describes the events with the understanding of
one who has resided for many years in Japan and China, asserting
that "one of the most remarkable changes to be wrought in
Christendom by the greatest of wars will be found, not in
Europe or in Europe's dependencies, but in the Far East";
recalling the words of Napoleon, "There lies a sleeping China.
Let him sleep: for when he moves he will move the world."
He has recorded his observations in a volume entitled: "The
Fall of Tsingtau," in which he describes the advance of the
Japanese Army; the beginning of the siege; the fleet bombarding
the city; the surrender. He also discusses analytically the
political and economic situations. His description of Tsingtau
"After the City's Fall" is here retold by arrangement with his
publishers, <i>Houghton, Mifflin and Company</i>: Copyright 1915,
by Jefferson Jones.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE CONQUERED TEUTON
FORT</p>

<p>Scenes of havoc met the eyes of the Japanese staff
officers when they entered the fallen forts of Tsingtau.
With dynamite and nitro-glycerine the German defenders
had destroyed the guns and demolished all that might
be taken by the captors as trophies of war. Along the
casemate walls of the forts still lay the German and
Japanese soldiers who had been killed in the final assault,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
while the concrete forts themselves were just a
mass of shale and twisted steel rods where dynamite or
falling shells had done their work.</p>

<p>Into the forts the Japanese filed and, collecting all the
German soldiers together in lots, marched them to the
barbed-wire entanglements in the rear of the city and
after a short rest took them to the foot of Prince Heinrich
Berg, where a prison camp had been improvised.
The German officers, however, through the courtesy of
the Japanese commander, were allowed to remain in
Tsingtau.</p>

<p>The courtesy of the Japanese, for which the Orient is
already famous, received an excellent demonstration in
the surrender of Tsingtau. General Kamio, commander-in-chief,
realizing that to march his victorious troops
through the city of Tsingtau would throw the residents
into much confusion and disorder, made the direct surrender
appear like a capitulation on terms. All German
officers, including Governor-General Meyer-Waldeck,
were allowed to go about Tsingtau at their freedom after
the surrender, and General Kamio at once posted orders
that only the Japanese staff officers would be allowed to
enter the city for several days. Japanese pickets were
placed along the roads outside of the city to see that this
regulation was enforced.</p>

<p>For several days, then, while the Japanese troops were
quartered in Moltke and Bismarck Barracks in the rear
of Tsingtau, and the British force was also in German
barracks, the residents of Tsingtau were given free opportunity
to recover from their besieged life without being
ruffled by the sight of marching and quartered troops.</p>

<p>During that period between the surrender of the Tsingtau
forts and November 16, when the British and Japanese
expeditionary forces made their triumphal entry into
the city, the Japanese officers busied themselves in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
final preparations for the transfer of the German possessions
into the hands of Dai Nippon. The rest of the
troops spent the days in examining the Tsingtau forts
and gradually the "whyfore" of their surrender was answered.</p>

<p>On Iltis Fort were mounted six twelve-centimeter guns,
two of which had been captured from the French in the
siege of Paris in 1871. On the left of this battery and
toward the rear of the fort had been placed four twenty-eight-centimeter
mortars, while two 10.5-centimeter guns
cast in 1889, which had seen service in the siege of Taku
in 1900, made up the remainder of the fort's equipment.</p>

<p>Bismarck Fort, to the left of Iltis, seemed to be the
most strongly fortified of any of the Tsingtau defenses.
Besides four twenty-eight-centimeter howitzers and two
twenty-one-centimeter guns, it contained the Tsingtau
battery of four fifteen-centimeter guns.</p>

<p>At Moltke Fort, on the bay side of the city, the German
garrison had mounted two fifteen-centimeter guns
stripped from the Austrian cruiser <i>Kaiserin Elisabeth</i>, a
field battery of ten pieces, three field howitzers, and several
small guns taken from the second-class German gunboats
and cruisers that had been allowed to be bottled
up in the Bay of Kiaochow.</p>

<p>The two German forts which commanded the sea approaches
were Huit-chien-huk and Tscha-nui-va. The
first was equipped with two twenty-four-centimeter guns
and three fifteen-centimeter guns, while the latter's equipment
consisted of two twenty-one-centimeter guns which
had been taken from the Chinese Taku forts in 1900.</p>

<p>The German garrison at Tsingtau at the opening of
the war, knowing that their surrender was inevitable, had
made all plans to keep as far as possible all trophies of
war from falling into the enemy's hands after surrender.
The result was that early on the morning of the 7th, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the Japanese infantry had gained the redoubt walls, all
preparations were made by the garrison for destroying
the guns.</p>

<p>The breech-block of each was wound with nitro-glycerine
and dynamite was placed in the cannons up to the
muzzle edge. The white flag was the signal. A few minutes
later, when the Japanese forces swarmed the forts,
they found the place a mass of wreckage. Big twenty-four-centimeter
guns were split in two as evenly and
neatly as if they had been cut by a jack-knife, while one
hundred or more yards distant could be found all that
remained of the breech-block. The four twenty-eight-centimeter
mortars on Iltis had been dynamited and just
a mass of twisted steel and splintered plates remained.</p>

<p>On Bismarck and Moltke Forts, many of the guns had
been backed in against the sandbag walls and dynamited
on their carriages. The discharge had left the place scattered
with the broken pieces of the carriages and split
sandbags. The guns in the majority of cases had fallen
down to the foot of the casemate walls. The explosions
of the dynamite also appeared to have wrecked adjacent
walls, for the concrete work about the gun-stands seemed
to be so much shale. Exposed to sight were the steel
pipes and wire used in the construction of the forts, all
twisted and broken.</p>

<p>This desire to keep trophies of war from the hands
of the enemy was not confined alone to guns. From the
various post-offices German officials gathered the colony's
issue of postage stamps and all were burned. Men had
evidently been detailed to handle the storehouses, for
all about them I found large cans of corned beef, sausages,
milk, saurkraut and German delicacies opened and
lying in heaps, their contents untouched.</p>

<p>All valuable papers in the vaults of Government buildings
that contained military secrets or maps of fortifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
throughout the Far East, were also made way
with; in fact the German garrison left little that the
Japanese could boast about, except the city of Tsingtau
itself.</p>

<p>As officially given out by the War Office, the Japanese
forces had a total of 142 guns on the firing line. They
consisted of six 28-centimeter howitzers, 72 other siege
guns of 15-and 24-centimeters, 18 mountain guns, 36
field pieces, and eight 4.7 and 6-inch guns of the marine
detachment.</p>

<p>According to figures given me by General Kamio, the
total active fighting force of the Japanese during the
siege was 20,000 men, while the British expedition force
consisted of 925 regulars, with a regiment of 300 Sikhs.</p>

<p>Opposing them was the German force of 4,500 men,
more than 700 of whom were sick or wounded or captured
before the actual siege started.</p>

<p>Among the criticisms directed against the defenders
of Tsingtau, which I heard after the surrender, especially
in the British camp, was that the Germans fired
away great quantities of ammunition at the beginning of
the bombardment of the fortifications so that, with their
supply exhausted, an excuse for the surrender could be
made. In proof of this they referred to the large number
of shells which fell daily about the Japanese forces while
they were getting the big siege guns into position. The
estimate of "more than two thousand German shells in
twelve hours' firing with no casualties to the Japanese
or British forces," was further evidence given.</p>


<p>II&mdash;THE GERMAN OFFICER'S TALE OF THE
SIEGE</p>

<p>On my first trip into Tsingtau I met a German officer
in the Prince Heinrich Hotel, who had taken part in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
siege, and questioned him as to the truth of the statement.</p>

<p>"Maybe that is what they say, but the facts are the
garrison had expected Tsingtau to fall sooner than it
did. Our heavy artillery fire was not kept up for the
purpose of throwing away our shells,&mdash;it would have been
less dangerous to have dropped them in the bay,&mdash;but
solely to do as much damage to the Japanese as possible
before the assault on the fortifications could be made.
We regulated our fire with the one purpose of covering
the country with shells before they had a chance to get
under cover. When they attempted to mount their siege
guns at the start of the bombardment their forces were
exposed to us. We could see their ammunition columns
and supply wagons rolling up on open roads and, by
spreading our fire about the valley, we were attempting
solely to postpone the fall of Tsingtau as much as possible
by hindering the allied forces in their work."</p>

<p>The officer then went on to tell me of the ruse Lieutenant
Trendel, manager of the Wagonlits Hotel at Peking,
who took part in the siege, played on the Japanese.
Trendel was in command of a battery of six old nine-centimeter
ships' guns which were in an exposed position
on a ridge near Iltis Fort. This battery received a
fire from both the ship and land guns, and the men could
be seen on the first day of the bombardment building
bomb-proofs in the dust and smoke from exploding shells.</p>

<p>In the night Lieutenant Trendel put up wooden guns,
roughly shaped from beams, at a distance of two hundred
yards from his own guns. In the morning, he exploded
powder near them to give an appearance of firing from
them. By this ruse he diverted the Japanese fire and
saved all his men, dynamiting his guns before the surrender.</p>

<p>Governor-General Waldeck, after the surrender, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the following statement as to the bombardment:&mdash;</p>

<p>The combatant force at Tsingtau did not amount to
more than forty-five hundred. The permanent garrison
consisted of eighteen hundred men nominally, but was, in
reality, about two hundred short. Some of those under
arms were mere boys. Each fort was defended by about
two hundred men.</p>

<p>The Tsingtau guns were mostly weapons captured from
the Boxers during their rebellion, or trophies of the
Franco-German War, and were no match for modern
arms. The Huichuan and Bismarck Forts, however, had
some modern pieces. Altogether there were, for the defense,
about sixty guns and a hundred machine guns.</p>

<p>The Iltis fort was guarded by sixty men. The Japanese
in their assault charged up under a hot fire as if
unconscious of their danger, and gained the position before
the defenders could call reinforcements.</p>

<p>The Bismarck and Moltke Forts were also taken by a
charge, but for the most part the Japanese conducted their
attack under cover of their trenches, and concealed themselves
so well that the most searching German fire could
not stop their advance. At length the supply of ammunition
ran out, and further defense was futile. I thought
the Japanese casualties would be very heavy, as they
fought bravely and charged desperately, and I estimated
their loss at five to six thousand. I have been astonished
to learn that the loss in killed and wounded amounts to
only seventeen hundred. They certainly showed remarkable
skill in taking cover.</p>

<p>Tsingtau was not an ideal fortification, such as Antwerp.
Strictly speaking, it was merely a defended position.
As possible enemies in the Far East, Germany
had calculated only on England, France and Russia. It
was quite unexpected that the blow would come from so
good a friend as Japan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The fire from the Japanese squadron was not so furious
as to cause any great inconvenience, except once
when a shell landed in the Huichan Point Fort, killed
thirteen and severely wounded three. In respect of accuracy
of range the fire of the British cruiser <i>Triumph</i>
was inferior to that of Japanese ships. The land fire,
however, was terrible. A perfect rain of shells fell on
the Bismarck, Iltis, and Hsiaochau Forts, and the central
batteries suffered severely. One of them received
as many as a hundred shells, and it was death to leave
the trenches for an instant.</p>

<p>Two days after the surrender I was able to get through
the picket line thrown about the rear of the city of
Tsingtau, and could observe better just what damage had
been done to the city during the seven days of bombardment.</p>


<p>III&mdash;WAR'S TYPHOON IN THE CITY</p>

<p>The city appeared as if a typhoon had passed through
it. Its wide asphalt and macadamized streets, fronted by
beautiful four- and five-story buildings of German architecture,
were vacant. Giant shells, some three feet
long and a foot in diameter, were lying about on sidewalk
and street still unexploded. Trees, splintered at
their bases, lay toppled over in the avenues. Windows
in the houses were shattered, while gaunt holes in the
sides of buildings, where shells had torn their way, made
the residence blocks appear to be gasping for air.</p>

<p>Out in the harbor could be seen the spars of the
<i>Rickmers</i> and two or three other German freighters,
which had been sunk at the opening of hostilities about
the city, while farther out in the channel was the grave
of the Austrian cruiser, <i>Kaiserin Elisabeth</i>, which had
been sunk by the Germans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole scene seemed one of devastation. Streets
deserted of people, show-fronts of stores completely
gone, as was also the merchandise, harbors deserted of
ships, and not even a sign of a ricksha to remind you
of the Orient.</p>

<p>Such was Tsingtau as I first saw it two days after its
surrender. But for the continual sight of the Rising
Sun flag flapping from every peak in the rear of the city,
as well as from every Government building, and its
message of "occupied," one would have thought Tsingtau
a city deserted.</p>

<p>This is the inspiring story of a typical British soldier. "I was

mother of soldiers. She took the news calmly, as the mother of
soldiers do; said good-bye to her eldest boy, who was to go with
the first troops who left England, arranged for the outfit of
her two second sons, and sent for her baby from Eton, who she
saw dispatched to the Royal Military College. It was a great
house to be in on the outbreak of War&mdash;a house whose sons to
the third and fourth generation had built up the British Empire,
and which now, when the Empire was called upon to fight for
its life, stood firm and undismayed." This platoon commander
tells his experiences in a book entitled "With My Regiment."

<i>The English Review</i>, and <i>The London Standard</i>. Some of them

<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE OLD WOMAN AT THE AISNE</p>

<p>We were moved to the village very suddenly. There
was no reason that we could see for the move. However,
this transpired later. It was getting dusk when
we reached the village. A and C Companies were sent
at once up to the firing-line, and B and D Companies
were lined along a ditch in support. The ditch had been
prepared for habitation by the regiment who had held it
before. At one point they had thrown some boards
across the ditch and made a house underneath. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
proved a very welcome shelter when later it came on to
rain. We lay in the ditch for an hour or two listening
to the last shells before nightfall, from one of our heavy
batteries, singing overhead. The shells were sent in
groups of three, and we could plainly hear each, whizz-whizz-whizz,
chasing each other through the air, perhaps
not more than twenty yards apart. We were comfortable
enough where we were, and idly speculated on
what errand of destruction the shells were bent. They
sounded nasty great things to have coming in the wrong
direction, and we wished the Germans joy of them.</p>

<p>About eight I felt hungry, and got out of the trench
to have a look round. I had two tins of Mc'Conochie
in my haversack, which I put in a pan of boiling water.
Across a field to the front I saw a farm, and decided
to go over and explore. In the field there were two or
three curious heaps of straw, which proved to be the
burial piles of dead cows, killed by shell fire, and covered
over by the farmer in this rather ineffective fashion.
The cows were getting smelly, and I did not stay long
looking at them. I found the farm occupied by two old
men and an old woman. One of the old men, over eighty,
they told me, had taken to his bed and lain there with
the shutters up for three days. He was half-dead from
fright, and could not be induced to move. The old woman
said they had had Germans billeted in the farm a week
before. They had treated her and her old husband none
too gently, driving them out of the house while they
made soup in her cauldron. She had managed to hide
one or two little bits of bread, and was making supper
off a crust and some coffee. She put the fire at my disposal
for getting supper ready for Goyle and the other
officers in the company. They all came across a quarter
of an hour later, Evans with a great possession&mdash;a tin
of cocoa. There was plenty of milk to be had from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
farm&mdash;indeed, it was a godsend to the old people to get
a man to milk their cows&mdash;and we soon had a beautiful
jug of thick, steaming cocoa. We then prepared the
Mc'Conochie, and what proved to be our last meal all
together was a good one.</p>


<p>II&mdash;WOUNDED&mdash;SCENES IN A NIGHT ATTACK</p>

<p>It was getting late when we had finished, and we had
to hurry back to the support trench. On the way, as I
was going along at a quick trot, I came head over heels
over a big object and nearly impaled myself on a spike.
Apart from the smell of the cow, it was really most
dangerous lying out there at night-time, and I sent a
party of men back to bury it.</p>

<p>The trenches we were to take over lay just beyond
the village along the crest of a slope. The section my
company was responsible for ran just in front of three
haystacks. A company extended away to our right,
and the Dorchester Regiment continued the line to our
left. The officer of the regiment we were relieving said
to me: "You see those stacks&mdash;well, I should keep clear
of them; the enemy have them set." I nodded, very tired
at finding myself back in the firing-line, where we had
been almost continuously for ten days, and not particularly
interested in what the enemy had set or what
they had not. In fact, as soon as I had seen the men
distributed along the trench, and had given one or two
orders about its improvement, I made straight for the
centre stack, pulled as much hay as I could out of the
side of it, rolled myself up, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>I was awakened by a sharp blow in the back. Looking
up I saw Evans drawing his foot back to give me a
second and harder kick.</p>

<p>"Get up, you blithering fool," he said; "your men are
out all over the place."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>I jumped to my feet, and, fastening my belt as I ran,
dashed for the trench. I owed a lot to Evans for waking
me. As Evans said, the men were all walking about outside
the trench. I got them in immediately, and was preparing
to follow when I thought of my bed, and went
off to fetch it. One never knew when the next chance
of leaving the trench might come. I was bending down,
gathering a good armful of hay, when there was a report,
a sensation like red-hot iron running through one,
followed by acute pain, and I pitched head-forward into
the hay. I had been hit. Very frightened and hurt, I
crawled as fast as I could round to the side farthest from
the enemy and sat down. I examined my wounds&mdash;a
bullet through each leg. The shots were low down and
did not look very serious. They hurt infernally, and I
made a mental note to call the next man who said he
never noticed he had been hit in the heat of an action a
liar. I examined the wounds. Were they serious enough
to warrant a visit to the field-dressing station and a possible
return to England? I hoped devoutly they were.
An attempt to stand soon satisfied me, and I fell down
again, much relieved. All these thoughts were a matter
of seconds; in the meanwhile there was a good deal going
on round the stack. An enemy battery was playing round
it with high-explosive shrapnel. The shells burst first
one side, then the other, in front, behind, in all directions.
The noise was deafening, and the lead in the air was
just like a hailstorm; however, it was a stout stack, and
kept me dry, though I confess I doubted getting away
alive. After a few minutes the firing stopped, and,
throwing myself on my side, I rolled as fast as I could
for a support trench. I pitched head-first into the trench
and landed on the top of two privates who were sheltering
in the bottom expecting more shrapnel over at any
minute. They were not expecting me, and thought their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
last hour had come when I fell on top of them. Getting
our breath, we all three cursed each other. Then, seeing
I was an officer, they became respectful. I explained
I was wounded, and they helped me off with my puttees
and bound up the wounds with the first-aid bandage
which I ripped from my coat. In the meanwhile word
was sent back for stretcher-bearers. As the firing had
stopped these came up immediately, lifted me out of the
trench, put me on a stretcher, and started off with me.
We had to go down a road in full view of the enemy.
For some providential reason they never fired at us,
though I was about the last wounded man to be brought
down that road. Halfway down the road the stretcher-bearers
began to show signs of feeling my weight. I
coaxed them on a few more yards, but when they came
to the lee of a cottage they put me down and shook their
heads; another bearer came to the rescue, and with the
extra help the party proceeded. A hundred yards more
brought us to a cottage which was being used as a field-dressing
station. The cottage was beginning to fill, and
wounded men lay about all over the floor.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gawd! Oh&mdash;! &mdash;&mdash;ooh!!"</p>

<p>"Shut up, can't yer?" a man shouted from the far
corner of the room.</p>

<p>"I've got a 'ole in me big enough to put yer 'and in,"
the sufferer explained, and began again to groan and
swear.</p>

<p>"Got a cigarette, mate?" A man deathly pale on a
stretcher held out his hand to a comrade who was slightly
wounded and standing beside him. The latter extricated
a Woodbine from a crumpled packet and passed it down.
The man on the stretcher lit the cigarette and puffed
at it phlegmatically. It was doubtful whether he would
live, and though he did not know this, he knew he must
not have anything to eat or drink for many hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>


<p>III&mdash;THE DOCTORS AND THE STRETCHER
BEARERS</p>

<p>About fifteen or twenty of us were lying on the floor
of a cottage. Outside, four or five hundred yards up
the street, a lively fight was in progress for the possession
of the village. After the firing-line the cottage
seemed a haven of peace and safety.</p>

<p>"Hullo, they've got you."</p>

<p>"Morning, Doctor."</p>

<p>A young fellow, fresh from his training at a hospital,
was standing beside me. He was our regimental doctor,
and I'd always thought of him as a lucky fellow who rode
on a horse when we were on the march, and got his
rations regularly at all times, and during a scrap enjoyed
the security of the extra few hundred yards which he
was supposed to have between his dressing-station and
the firing-line. Well, here he was to look after me,
anyhow.</p>

<p>"Got a bit of work to do to-day, Doctor," I said as he
bound me up.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, adjusting a blanket as a pad under
me, "there, just keep in that position and the bleeding will
soon stop." He turned to the man next me.</p>

<p>"I've got some across the way, too," he said, as the
orderly handed him fresh bandages. "They've been
shelling the poor beggars, knocking all the slates off the
roof."</p>

<p>As he spoke some shrapnel crashed against the roof
of our cottage, sending a few tiles rattling to the ground.
The doctor looked up.</p>

<p>"I think we're all right here," he said. "We've got a
double roof. I always try to pick a cottage with a double
roof. But those poor devils over the way are getting
awful scared; I think I'll slip across to them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The bit of road he had to "slip across" was catching
most of the shells which the cottage did not, and was
also the channel for a steady stream of rifle and machine-gun
fire. I began to see there wasn't much in it, whether
one was a doctor or a platoon commander.</p>

<p>More especially did I realize a doctor's difficulties
when, later in the day, just as our doctor had finished
looking at my dressings, a message came that the field-dressing
station belonging to the regiment on our left
had been set alight by a shell. He hastily organized a
party of stretcher-bearers and orderlies and went off at
once. Later he came back. He said it had been terrible
to see the wounded lying helpless in the barn waiting
for the flames, but somehow they had managed to rescue
all and move them to a safer place, though the whole
operation had to be carried out under rifle and shell fire.
Each time a regiment is seriously engaged with the
enemy at least 100 men are hit, often four times the
number. The regimental doctor is supposed to bind up
each one of these, and often when times are slack and a
stray man here or there gets hit he will be sent for to
come up to the trenches.</p>

<p>"'Allo, Jock," loud greetings were shouted by every
one in the room to a little man standing in the doorway
with a bandolier across his chest and rifle with bayonet
still fixed. He was a grubby little fellow, with blood and
mud caked all down his cheek, ragged clothes, and&mdash;as I
had seen as he came up the cottage steps&mdash;a pronounced
limp. It was Private Mutton, scallawag, humorist, and
well-known character in the regiment.</p>

<p>"Yus, they got me," he said in answer to inquiries,
"fro' me calf," he pointed to his leg, "and right acrost
the top of me 'ead"&mdash;he raised his cap and showed where
a bullet had parted his hair, grazing the scalp. "But I
give the bloke somethink what did it." Private Mutton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
grinned at his bayonet. "Got 'im fair, right fro' 'is
stomick."</p>

<p>I could not help feeling delighted, for I recognized
in the muddy, gory, highly-pleased-with-himself little
man the original of Thomas Atkins, of whose doings
along the Indian frontier I had read thrilling accounts by
Mr. Kipling, and whose quaint mannerisms I had often
laughed at as represented on the stage of music-halls at
home....</p>

<p>At 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the ambulances came up.</p>

<p>The doctor went round quickly attending to each man.
He bound up my wounds afresh and had me carried into
an inner room. I lay there all day, and never shall I
forget the experience. I could see nothing except a bit
of the wall on the opposite side of the street. But I could
hear. Just after I had been brought in fresh firing broke
out. Rifle fire this time, sharp and insistent. Then
there was a sound of stamping feet, and I heard an officer
rallying the men at the corner of the street. The firing
continued all day and sometimes seemed to rage almost
at the door of the cottage. I gathered that the Germans
were attacking the village in masses, and that it was
touch-and-go whether we could hold out. Sometimes
there would be a rush of men outside the window, and I
would look to see if the pale grey uniform was there or
if khaki still held the place. Every now and then a
shower of shrapnel struck the roof of the cottage, and
tiles went rattling to the road. All the while a section of
our artillery fired incessantly. How gallant those guns
of ours sound&mdash;Boom-boom-boom. They were fighting
to their last shell. If the village went, they went with it.
No horses could be brought up to draw them away in
such an inferno. The doctor worked on quietly. His
work extended now to houses on the left and right. He
said it was terrible to see the fear of death on the faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of men shot through the stomach. He found time once
to have a cup of tea with me and smoke a cigarette.
Night began to fall and the room grew dark. I was glad
of his company for five minutes. We were in the same
boat, he told me&mdash;if the Germans got the village he was
going to stay behind with the wounded.</p>

<p>At half-past five Evans came in with a smashed arm.</p>

<p>"Goyle has gone," he said. "He was hit twice before
during the day. He was holding out with a few men
there and got a third through the chest which did him.
Edwards was shot through the knee, and we had to leave
him. All the company officers are down. A company
has been surrounded and cut off. Whew! you can't live
out there." As he spoke the firing swelled to a din unequalled
through the day. We heard shouts and curses.
The Germans were making a final tremendous effort to
break through.</p>

<p>"Our boys may do it," said Evans, "but there are not
many left." I lay back against the wall, pulled out a
cigarette, and threw one to Evans. We could only wait.
Suddenly outside we heard a stamp of feet, a hoarsely
yelled order, "Fix bayonets!" another word of command,
and a mass of men rushed past the window up the
street, cheering madly.</p>

<p>"That's the &mdash;&mdash;s," cried a stretcher-bearer, who
came in excitedly. "They have been sent up from the
reserve."</p>

<p>The doctor came in. "We've got two more regiments
up; we shall be all right now," he said.</p>

<p>For a moment the firing continued, then died down.
Night came and found us still holding the village, and
at ten o'clock the ambulance took us away.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF COUNT SEILERN</h2>

<div class="center"><i>A Tragedy of the Hapsburgs</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>Assassinations, abductions, and scandals of every kind loom
large in the records of the reigning Austrian house, and many
of its crimes have not yet come to light, as this amazing story
proves. But for the confession of an Austrian prisoner of war,
anxious to relieve his mind of the burden that oppressed it,
this latest instance of Hapsburg treachery would never have
been heard of beyond the precincts of the Hofburg. "Le
Matin," the well-known French newspaper, first drew attention
to this officer's extraordinary story, which is here set forth in
full, and as nearly as possible in his own words. It is a tragic
tale indeed, a tale of love and duplicity in high places, which he
told to the <i>Wide World Magazine</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE VENETIAN NOBLEMAN</p>

<p>The first time I met Count Seilern and became acquainted
with the anteccedents of this brilliant young
officer, the heir of a noble Viennese family, was during
the summer of 1914, whilst I was undergoing a cure at
one of the Austrian spas, which, owing to my desire to
remain as anonymous as possible, I will leave unnamed.
We were both members of an international club, run by
an American, who offered his patrons "all the usual
casino attractions to be found elsewhere." True, there
was neither roulette nor <i>trente-et-quarante</i>, but, under
the cloak of a long list of subsidiary and innocent beguilements,
such as golf, tennis, and pigeon-shooting, the game
of baccarat flourished in a manner that bore a very respectable
similarity to the famous allurements of the
great French Riviera resort.</p>

<p>It was here&mdash;one evening in mid-June&mdash;that I was introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to Count Seilern, and that he offered to introduce
me as a member of the inner <i>cercle</i>.</p>

<p>Nothing is so revelatory of a man's character as his
attitude under the temptations of the gaming-table. I
have gambled many times, but have always known when
to respond to the promptings of the spirit of prudence
and leave off. I gambled at C&mdash;&mdash;, but only until the
moment when I considered I had paid a sufficiently high
entrance-fee for the privilege of studying my fellow-clubmen
in general and Count Seilern in particular.</p>

<p>This new acquaintance of mine attracted me from the
very first. In spite of the weakness of his character,
which was evident all the more clearly the longer he
played, it was impossible for anyone of education and
refinement not to like him. There was something even
in the manner in which he coquetted with the Goddess of
Chance which compelled one's admiration.</p>

<p>A little less than a week later I was in a position to
judge the character of my new friend infinitely better.
Personal observation had taught me that he could be
both chivalrous and generous. I noted more than once
that, however reckless he might be at times, there were
moments when he could give himself up to day-dreams
and calm reflection. This was to me a puzzling problem
of his personality until, almost simultaneously with these
early days of our acquaintanceship, fresh light came from
certain brother officers, who volunteered to put me <i>au
courant</i> with details concerning his private life which
were known only to the innermost circle of Viennese
society.</p>

<p>These new facts, which explained so much that had
hitherto been vague or unintelligible, were as fuel added
to the fire of my imagination. Count Seilern suddenly
became, in my eyes, a hero of romance. Yet I cannot
say that it was wholly admiration which now filled me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
An indescribable feeling of pity, mingled with fear, came
over me whilst I was listening, strolling one afternoon
under the trees in the admirable park of C&mdash;&mdash;, after
drinking the regulation number of glasses of water from
my favourite spring, to the first of those startling disclosures.</p>

<p>"There goes the man who is playing with fire," said
my companion, as Count Seilern's well-known olive-green
car, with himself at the wheel, glided past us and disappeared
round a curve of the road leading to the golf-links.</p>

<p>"Has he been losing heavily again?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Possibly. But I'm not referring to his proclivity to
waste time and money at the International. There are
far more ways than that by which a man may play with
fire, and if gaming were the Count's only little diversion,
many a mind in his family&mdash;one of the oldest in Austria,
you know&mdash;would be set at rest. Whatever losses he
may have, the means to meet them will always be more
than sufficient, for the Seilerns possess untold wealth.
It is for that reason, I suppose, that the Count aspires
so high. No, the particular danger which threatens him
is of a wholly different order to the one you have in
mind. It is a case, my friend, of '<i>cherchez la femme</i>.'
But surely you know of that last winter's affair of his?"</p>

<p>"Not a word reached my ears. I was away from
Vienna, on a mission, the whole of last winter."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, now I come to think about it, you might
not have heard anything if you'd been there, for the
affair was kept very quiet, and those in the secret were
pledged not to mention the lady's real name. When I
tell you that she is a young Archduchess, closely related
to the Archduchess Maria Theresa, and the victim of a
most unfortunate marriage, you will understand what I
mean by referring to Seilern playing with fire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, ho! so that's it? And you are certain he is still
infatuated with the lady?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely, unfortunately for him. But let me tell
you all about it from the beginning."</p>


<p>II&mdash;TRAGEDY OF THE AUSTRIAN ARCHDUCHESS</p>

<p>The story of the young Archduchess Valeria&mdash;to give
her the fictitious name my informant used, and which is
now doubly necessary&mdash;is one that has been encountered
before in the annals of the Royal Family of Austria.</p>

<p>When the time came for her marriage, those who jealously
watch over the conservation of the so-called purity
of the Royal blood, carefully chose a husband and&mdash;naturally,
against her will&mdash;united her to a man fully
twelve years her senior. Had this been his only disqualification
to be the husband of so young and charming a
creature as the Archduchess Valeria, she would have
had less reason to complain.</p>

<p>Alas! it was not long before she found he was one of
the most abject personages who ever crawled within the
shadow of the throne of the Hapsburgs. He was a degenerate,
in every sense of the word, and possessed a
most unenviable reputation.</p>

<p>Into the details of his career I will not enter, as my
outspoken informant did, but enough has been said to
enable you to form an idea of the married life of the
Archduchess Valeria&mdash;if, indeed, that adjective can be
applied to an existence in which cruelty, drink, and
debauchery played so large a part on the husband's side.</p>

<p>Is it surprising that, childless as she happily was, and
still sufficiently young and unbroken in spirit to hope for
happier days, the Archduchess turned her eyes longingly
elsewhere and encountered those of Count Seilern? There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
are some who contend that the idyll dated from the days
before her marriage, and a tale went the rounds of aristocratic
circles that the young Count first made the Archduchess's
acquaintance when he was a military student
and she little more than a schoolgirl. But that may well
be the embroidery which is often added to undoubted
facts, and these, for which the speaker said he could
personally vouch, were briefly as follows:</p>

<p>Count Seilern, whose family relations gave him many
opportunities of seeing the Archduchess, had entered on
a sentimental and clandestine intrigue with her. They
had corresponded for some time and seen each other repeatedly
before their attachment was discovered. Suspicions
having been aroused, the Archduchess's correspondence
had been intercepted and the truth made known
not only to the husband but to the Emperor Francis
Joseph himself. The aged ruler, who had helped to plan
the marriage, fell into a fit of anger on hearing of this
"fresh attempt to smirch the honour of his family"&mdash;an
outburst so violent that fears were entertained that
it might have a bad effect on his precarious health. It
would undoubtedly have gone ill with Count Seilern but
for two considerations: a knowledge of the disreputable
character of the Archduchess Valeria's husband, whose
escapades could only be kept hidden from the public by
suppressing the scandal, and the powerful influence which
the Count possessed, not only in his own family and
society <i>milieu</i>, but even in certain sacrosanct circles of
the Court itself. So the terrible old man, raging in his
heart over the ever-recurring evidence of the moral laxity
of his own flesh and blood, decided to let Count
Seilern off with a simple warning, dexterously brought
to his notice, and to give orders that the Archduchess
and her correspondence should in future be kept under
strict supervision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>A means was found of separating the lovers. Count
Seilern's military superiors sent him off on a mission
lasting several months&mdash;a mission whose real object was
self-evident to the young officer; the Archduchess's husband
suddenly developed a desire for Italian travel and
dragged his wife with him. Thus were the lovers' hopes
crushed. But only for a time. Once more, through
mutual friends, they found a means of occasional correspondence,
and thus kept alive the hope that, some day,
an odious marriage would be brought to an end&mdash;by
death or otherwise, they cared not which&mdash;and that then
their union would be made possible.</p>

<p>"That is the stage," continued my friend, "at which
we find Count Seilern to-day. He and she are simply
waiting. But they are, as it were, prisoners, whose movements
are watched, whose correspondence is liable to be
read by the 'Cabinet Noir' of Vienna, and concerning
whom anything suspicious may be reported to headquarters.
As regards the consequences of any indiscretion,
the Archduchess, owing to her rank, has less to fear than
the Count. Had the <i>rôles</i> been reversed, Francis Joseph
might have set things straight, as he did in the case of the
Archduke Francis Ferdinand, by granting permission,
under certain conditions, for a morganatic marriage. But
this is a case in which a male 'outsider' dares to aspire to
set the rigourous 'family law' of the reigning house at
defiance&mdash;and the very idea of such a thing is, you know,
abhorrent to the Emperor. Hence the danger which continually
hangs over the head of this really splendid man.
It is devoutly to be hoped that he will exercise extreme
prudence and avoid the snares which our police are capable
of setting for him at the instigation of the crafty
and fanatical man who rules over us. But I fear that
Seilern's headstrong nature will some day play him
false."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The premonitory signs of the whirlwind which was to
sweep us all off our feet towards the end of the following
month completely threw this conversation into the
background of my mind. Everything in the social world
of C&mdash;&mdash; suffered an eclipse through the assassination of
the Archduke Francis Ferdinand and his morganatic
wife.</p>


<p>III&mdash;FIRST RUMBLES OF GREAT WAR IN
VIENNA</p>

<p>We military men, acquainted with the aspirations of
the Austrian General Staff, knew only too well the far-reaching
effect the crime of Sarajevo was likely to have.
Our sole interest became the crisis, our sole topic of
conversation from morning until night the probability of
war. The baccarat rooms of the International Club were
deserted, and it was the same with all other amusements
and recreations. Only a few English and American enthusiasts
continued to frequent the golf-links and the
tennis-courts, apparently oblivious of the volcano on
which they were dallying. The arrival of the whirlwind
itself&mdash;the mobilization order and the certainty that the
first shots in the great war would soon be fired&mdash;speedily
aroused them from their apparent indifference. Then
came the sudden emptying of the hotels, the rush of
panic-stricken visitors to the station, and our own precipitate
departure for Vienna and the Staff headquarters.
Can one be astonished at the fact that the petty private
affairs of Count Seilern and the Archduchess Valeria
were momentarily obliterated by the great world-drama
in which we were to play our respective parts?</p>

<p>More than four months had elapsed since the outbreak
of war. The approach of Christmas found us on the
battlefield and, alas! as far from our goal as on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
occasion when we officers of the General Staff, assembled
on the eve of our departure for the Front, raised
our glasses and drank to the day of victory. All hope
of a short campaign had gone for ever. Being now a
prisoner of war, I can confess to my feelings of those
days without the slightest compunction, and frankly admit
that, despite our undoubted military successes, I was a
disappointed man. How could my mental attitude be
otherwise when I sat down and calmly compared the
early weeks of the war with the existing situation?</p>

<p>Candidly, I was full of disillusionments, and to add
still more to my wretchedness in the little Hungarian
village where we were stationed, certain personal grievances
weighed heavily upon me. Picture a soldier of
my active and imaginative temperament, who had lived
for weeks in the hope of participating in the glory of
battle, being forced to live that quasi-military life somewhere
at the back of the Front.</p>

<p>I was not the only one who felt the monotony of that
existence, made up of receiving and transmitting reports,
coding and deciphering messages, poring over maps, and
otherwise taking part in the office work of the General
Staff. Some of my brother-officers were perhaps more
patient and philosophic than I was, but I am convinced
there was not one of them who, at the bottom of his
heart, was not heartily sick of this vegetating life at the
end of the telegraph wires, far from the actual scenes
of operations.</p>

<p>But I am wandering a little from my story, and mentioning
my brother-officers brings me back to the main
theme. Whom do you think&mdash;to the infinite satisfaction
of a man yearning for congenial society, no less than to
his great surprise&mdash;they included? Of all people in the
world, no other than Count Seilern!</p>

<p>Retrospection&mdash;backed up by a nature essentially fatalistic&mdash;forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
me to the conclusion that I was destined to
meet this man again and to play a prominent part in his
life. How can one set down to a mere coincidence that
second meeting and the blossoming of our acquaintanceship
of the International Club of C&mdash;&mdash; into a close
friendship, any more than one can think that it was due
to mere chance that I should then have learnt so much
(for my future guidance) relating to his private history,
in which, again, I was to be, in such strange circumstances,
both actor and historian?</p>

<p>Since Fate, then, has made me the historian of this
tragic tale, let me come at once to the facts and so relieve
my mind of some part of the burden which I fear will
always oppress it.</p>

<p>Count Seilern held the rank of first lieutenant of cavalry.
Being the bearer of one of the noblest names in
Austria, he benefited by a certain amount of protection.
His duties were much less onerous than ours, but on
that account the monotony of his existence must have
been all the greater. More than once, indeed, he confessed
to me how much he felt it. Coupling certain
remarks of his with information which came to me from
a sure source, I saw clearly the principal reason which,
as Christmas drew near, made him sadder and sadder.
It was evident that he was filled with an ardent desire
to see the Archduchess Valeria once more. Taking advantage
of the unsettled state of the nation's affairs, the
lovers had found a means of once more corresponding
with each other freely, and, as was shortly to be proved
to us, of concocting one of the most daring of plans.</p>

<p>It was undoubtedly the fertile brain of the Archduchess
Valeria which conceived a means of putting the much-relaxed
vigilance of the Court authorities off the scent.
All difficulties were removed by her patience and veritable
genius for intrigue. On the plea of taking an active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
part in war work, she succeeded in severing all relations
with her ignoble consort, and&mdash;having obtained a first-class
training as a nurse&mdash;secured an engagement in a
Red Cross hospital train circulating in the very sector, at
the rear of the armies, where we were stationed.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;THE DRAMATIC LOVERS' MEETING IN
THE HOSPITAL TRAIN</p>

<p>At last the day arrived when a meeting between the
lovers was possible. It was but a week to Christmas
(according to the eye-witness who related these dramatic
incidents to me) when, one morning, the hospital train
stopped at the nearest station to the headquarters of the
Army of the Carpathians. Count Seilern was waiting on
the platform. He mounted into one of the compartments.
The train, naturally, contained neither sick nor wounded
men&mdash;only her Royal Highness, accompanied by a small
and discreet suite. Nobody had been told of her presence,
not even the Chief of Staff himself, General Conrad
von Hoetzendorf.</p>

<p>The interview lasted a long time, and it was, doubtless,
whilst the lovers were forgetting the fleeting hours that
some diligent spy went to inform the General. Before
the train continued on its journey, the Archduchess
Valeria descended on to the platform to spend the last
few minutes with the Count. Suddenly Conrad von
Hoetzendorf appeared on the scene and immediately recognized
her Royal Highness, in spite of the simplicity
of her Red Cross nurse's uniform.</p>

<p>"I shall never forget that scene as long as I live," said
my informant; "a scene rendered all the more dramatic
owing to the fact that its opening passed without a word
being spoken. General Conrad von Hoetzendorf, in the
presence of a scandal for which he might be rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
responsible, went white with anger. After making a
well-nigh imperceptible bow to the Archduchess Valeria&mdash;who
almost at once bade the Count adieu, and mounted
into her compartment&mdash;he fixed his cold, grey eyes upon
Seilern and kept them there until the train moved out of
the station. As he stood there, like a statue, we who
were around him could see the nervous twitching of the
fingers of his clenched fists, and could interpret the
thoughts passing through his brain. His heart was raging&mdash;first
of all at the idea that his authority as the military
chief had been set at naught; secondly, because he
saw a danger to himself in the incident; and thirdly, on
account of being placed, as it were, in a position of inferiority
as regards the man whom he had detected in
what he regarded as a flagrant breach of discipline. In
brief, belonging, as he does, to the new nobility, he was
jealous of the good fortune of his subordinate&mdash;this simple
first lieutenant, who turned not a hair, caught, though
he was, in the act. But, like a wise courtier, Hoetzendorf
refrained from giving verbal expression to these feelings,
and it was not until the train&mdash;with the Princess waving
her handkerchief to her lover from one of the windows,
and Seilern replying with a salute&mdash;passed out of sight,
that he opened his lips. Even then, it was merely to order
Count Seilern, in the iciest of tones, to come to see him at
headquarters. In the presence of his <i>entourage</i> it was
necessary for him to make an example of the offender&mdash;if
only for the purpose of ridding himself of responsibility.
With the words, 'Lieutenant Count Seilern, you
will come to see me this evening at five, without fail,'
he turned on his heels and strode away in the direction
of his car."</p>

<p>From that time onwards, the action of the drama in
which Count Seilern became involved quickened with
bewildering rapidity. The incidents which immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
followed I can describe from personal knowledge, for it
was my painful privilege to be present at the interview
which took place between General Conrad von Hoetzendorf
and the man whom I had by this time determined to
support through thick and thin.</p>

<p>With the exception of the General's secretary, who had
brought him some letters to be signed, I was the only
person present when Count Seilern, punctual to the minute,
was announced and ushered into the room of the
Commander-in-Chief, situated in a small <i>schloss</i> on the
outskirts of the village.</p>

<p>A steely look came into Hoetzendorf's eyes as the
young officer entered and, with an apology for a salute,
stood before him. The General continued to sign his
letters, unperturbed, and without omitting a single flourish
after his signature. Having come to the last one, the
secretary seized the batch of correspondence and hastened
to retire. I was about to do the same, having
practically come to the end of my own business, when the
General motioned to me to remain, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain &mdash;&mdash;, I wish you to stay here. You are, if I
mistake not, the lieutenant's friend, so there is no reason,
it seems to me, why you should not be present while I
make a few friendly observations to Count Seilern. They
relate to a little affair which, as I dare say you know,
occurred this morning."</p>

<p>Uneasy at being retained as a witness of a scene which
I instinctively felt would be of the most painful character,
I glanced at my friend with the object of catching
his eye, and expressing to him by a look my uncomfortable
state of mind.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, he relieved my feelings. At least,
I interpreted an almost imperceptible nod of his haughtily-raised
head to mean that he was rather pleased than
otherwise I was there. I noted&mdash;not without anxiety&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
certain arrogance in his bearing, as though he were still
intoxicated by the declarations and promises which, presumably,
had been made to him in the course of his
<i>tête-à-tête</i> with the Archduchess. On hearing Hoetzendorf
speak of "friendly observations," he perceptibly
bridled and coldly, almost insolently, replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And what may they be, General?"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Count Seilern," began Conrad von
Hoetzendorf, nervously toying with his pen, and evidently
making a great effort both to keep his temper
and choose his words carefully, "it is almost needless
to say that it gives me very great pain to have had to
summon you here. But I was in duty bound to do so.
You, as a soldier, will surely appreciate my position&mdash;the
very difficult position in which your conduct, which
it was impossible for me to regard otherwise than as
reprehensible, has placed me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Reprehensible? Opinions differ, General von
Hoetzendorf," interjected Count Seilern.</p>

<p>"Allow me to inform you, once for all, Lieutenant
Seilern," replied the General, omitting my friend's title
and laying a slight emphasis on his rank, "that as regards
a question of military discipline, I can permit of no two
opinions. It is your duty to remember that we are on
campaign, and that this is no time for society play."</p>

<p>"I am of the opinion, General von Hoetzendorf, that
my time is my own when off duty, as was the case this
morning," rapped out Count Seilern, white to the eyes.</p>

<p>"Your time is Austria's&mdash;by which I mean that, even
when off duty, you should remember that this is no time
for the amusements to which members of your class are
unfortunately addicted in days of peace. I repeat that
the dalliance of which you have been guilty is highly
reprehensible, so long as you are under my command,
and I have reason to believe that my Imperial master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
would support me in this view. Understand, therefore&mdash;&mdash;"</p>


<p>V&mdash;IMPERIAL MANDATE&mdash;THE SOLDIER'S
ARREST</p>

<p>But the General's further "friendly observations" were
never completed. His veiled reference to the Archduchess
and the displeasure of the Emperor Francis
Joseph, indicating, as it did, that he had received instructions
on the subject, had the most disastrous effect
on Count Seilern, who, in a paroxysm of rage, exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is a private matter which concerns only another
and myself! Your Imperial mandate extends to my military
duties, which I have always carried out with precision,
and no further."</p>

<p>"Silence!" cried Hoetzendorf, springing to his feet and
stretching out his hand to touch the button of an electric
bell on his table. "We will very soon see about that!"</p>

<p>It was then that the irreparable happened. Count
Seilern, either through interpreting the General's gesture
as a menace to his personal safety, or because he was
carried away by anger, brought his hand to the hilt of
his sword, and, at the very moment that an aide-de-camp,
in reply to the summons, appeared in the doorway,
partly drew the weapon from its scabbard.</p>

<p>"I order you to disarm Lieutenant Count Seilern and
place him under arrest," said the General, drawing himself
up to his full height as he instinctively stepped back
a few paces. "Call the guard immediately. Captain
&mdash;&mdash;," turning his head in my direction, "you are a witness
of this inexcusable act of insubordination. I shall
require you shortly to give evidence, so you may as well
draw up a report of what you have heard and seen without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
delay. Soldiers, remove the prisoner to the guard-room."</p>

<p>As Count Seilern was led away, proud and defiant, I
saw clearly that the danger of which I had been informed
at C&mdash;&mdash; was still hanging over his head. Moreover, the
conviction suddenly came to me that Conrad von Hoetzendorf
was acting as an agent for those who were attempting
to counter the plans of this over-ambitious man. An
inkling of this was given me by the Count himself during
the confrontation, by the expression of his face and his
manner, no less than by the indignant words, "Your
Imperial mandate extends to my military duties&mdash;and no
further." I seemed to read therein the Count's recognition
that he was the victim of a cabal, which was drawing
a net ever closer and closer around him.</p>

<p>General von Hoetzendorf might have judged and condemned
Count Seilern there and then, but postponed this
disagreeable duty; and I have a very good idea why.
When, an hour later, I handed in my report (the most
obnoxious piece of work I have ever done in my life) I
found him in deep thought. All he said, ere I withdrew,
was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very good, Captain &mdash;&mdash;, I will read what you have
written later. The affair can stand over for a while,
until I call a court-martial."</p>

<p>It was evident (thought I) that the General was considering
what the effects of all this was going to be on
himself. He was torn between his allegiance to his Imperial
master and a desire to avoid the enmity of the powerful
families with whom the Seilerns were allied. A
soldier by profession, he had an instinctive hatred of
being connected in the slightest degree with Court
intrigues, and especially at such a time as that, when
the whole of his mental power ought to have been concentrated
on the business of war. For these reasons (I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
was convinced) he had contented himself with placing
Count Seilern, for the time being, under arrest in a small
house&mdash;used as a guard-room&mdash;in the village, with two
sentinels at the door.</p>

<p>But what were my unfortunate friend's thoughts in this
prison? Some of them I learnt within the next few days;
others, which enable me to complete the picture of Count
Seilern's meditations, which few of us imagined were to
lead, within a week, to such a startling complication of
his life drama, came with later knowledge.</p>

<p>He thought at first, but only for a moment, of committing
suicide, in order to avoid a dishonouring sentence.
On reflection he came to the conclusion that there was a
chance of the General hesitating to be too severe on him,
through a desire to remain on good terms with all parties
concerned. It was then that certain so-called friends
called on the prisoner and made a most extraordinary
proposal to him&mdash;that he should allow himself to be represented
at his forthcoming trial as irresponsible! But
he was too well acquainted with the scandalous chronicles
of the Hapsburgs not to know what such a "favour"
meant. He called to mind the fate of the unhappy Louise
of Belgium, who spent seven years in asylums to satisfy
the rancour of Philip of Coburg.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> How thoroughly in
accordance with tradition was this suspicious proposal&mdash;made,
he had not the slightest doubt, at the suggestion of
Conrad Von Hoetzendorf! He also thought of the tragic
end of Rudolf of Hapsburg, and the many other crimes
committed with the tacit approbation of the Hofburg.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;THE LOVER'S FLIGHT FROM THE
HAPSBURG PRISON</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>
<p>As a result of these reflections he at last came to a
definite conclusion. He determined, encouraged by certain
friends, to make a bold bid for liberty and effect his
escape, even though he might have to resort to violence,
hoping that, once in Vienna, the Archduchess and her
friends would protect him.</p>

<p>Working in conjunction with two or three devoted
friends, whom this ever-popular man never lacked wherever
he might be, he succeeded in inspiring confidence
in the two soldiers who guarded him, and who, moreover,
watched over him with the consideration due to his rank.</p>

<p>One morning the door of the little Hungarian house
in which Count Seilern had been imprisoned for a little
less than a week was found open, and there, before the
entrance, was the evidence of the means which the prisoner's
friends had adopted to rescue him. Stretched on
the ground were the unconscious bodies of the two sentinels,
heavily drugged by Seiler's accomplices.</p>

<p>Shortly before this occurrence, which, though it naturally
created a great sensation in the immediate circle
of the Staff, was thrown into the background by military
events of considerable importance and the consequent
long-desired removal of headquarters to a place nearer
the Front, there occurred an event which I cannot but
regard as connected with it. A certain Baron A&mdash;&mdash;,
one of Seilern's intimate friends, found the means of
obtaining permission to return to Vienna. The alleged
reason for his departure was urgent family business&mdash;some
sudden illness or similar call for his presence at
home; but I am convinced that its real object was to
prepare a sure hiding-place for the fugitive Count. It
matters not what my reasons may be for so thinking;
suffice it to say that information received from a sure
source led me not only to that conclusion but to many
other inferences. I learnt, for instance, that the particulars
of what was now known as the "Seilern Affair" had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
leaked out, that the hiding-place of the Count was already known
to the police of the Austrian capital, but that <i>no
attempt was being made to arrest him</i>. It was evident,
indeed, that powerful influences were at work, and that
every possible means was being taken to hush up the
scandal.</p>

<p>Later, I learnt that recourse was had to the advice of
the aged Princess M&mdash;&mdash;, the oracle of the higher society
circles of Vienna, whose wisdom has been brought to bear
on every "good" scandal at the Court of the Hapsburgs
during more than the half-century she has made the laws
of the fashionable world there.</p>

<p>Whilst Princess M&mdash;&mdash; was setting her acute wits to
work, the Archduchess Valeria, more and more determined
never to return to her ignoble husband, and realizing
that the great crisis in her life had at last come, took
refuge at the house of some faithful family retainers.
The outcome of Princess M&mdash;&mdash;'s ingenious reflections
was that Baron A&mdash;&mdash; was found a further useful mission
in conjunction with the affair. This trusted emissary
was sent to Berne as a diplomatic messenger, the
alleged bearer of confidential documents for Count von
G&mdash;&mdash;, a high Austro-Hungarian official and the representative
of our Government with the Swiss Confederation.</p>

<p>Holding the opinions I do in regard to the policy which
is bringing my poor country to the brink of ruin, I have
no hesitation in speaking my mind about some of the
men who compose its diplomatic corps. Let me explain,
then, that von G&mdash;&mdash;, a former head of the Cabinet of
Count Aerenthal, is one of the most equivocal figures in
the diplomacy of the Ballplatz. Frigid in his courtesy,
scrupulously careful not to offend anyone of importance,
pitiless to the weak and servile to the powerful, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the mere tool of the Minister who first brought Austro-Hungary
under the dominations of Berlin.</p>

<p>You can easily imagine the unctuous politeness with
which this Machiavellian diplomatist received the man
who called upon him with a letter from Princess M&mdash;&mdash;,
asking him, in the cordial and guarded terms which her
pen can so well indite, to favour the love affair of Count
Seilern and hush up a scandal which, "if generally
known, would do incalculable harm, at a time when we
have more and more need of enlisting the respect of the
subjects of His Most Gracious and Imperial Majesty."</p>

<p>"What would I not do to oblige Princess M&mdash;&mdash;?" exclaimed
the Count von G&mdash;&mdash;, on coming to the end of
the letter and turning his heavily-whiskered face to Baron
A&mdash;&mdash; (who related the interview to me). "Will you
transmit that expression of my devotion to her Royal
Highness, and say that I live in the hope of accomplishing
much, <i>much</i> more than this truly insignificant service?
You will, of course, understand, my dear Baron, that
this is strictly <i>entre nous</i>. No documentary evidence of
my connection with this affair must exist, and&mdash;<i>je vous
en prie!</i>&mdash;not a word about this interview. See, I carry
out her Royal Highness's request this very minute and
destroy her letter"&mdash;tearing it in pieces and throwing
them into his waste-paper basket. "I will leave you to
acknowledge its receipt. It is always best to transact
little affairs of this sort strictly by word of mouth. You
will call upon me once or twice and we will arrange&mdash;verbally,
mark you&mdash;for the accommodation of these turtle-doves
of the dear Princess. And, once on this free
Helvetian soil, we will assist them&mdash;as in the story-books,
ha, ha!&mdash;to live happily ever afterwards."</p>

<p>A few days later, Count Seilern himself, provided,
thanks to Princess M&mdash;&mdash;'s influence, backed up by the
collaboration of Count von G&mdash;&mdash;and Baron A&mdash;&mdash;,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
with passports, crossed the frontier. He had shaved off
his moustache and had all the appearance of a young
man little more than twenty. His extremely youthful
physiognomy enabled him to pass as the secretary of the
Archduchess Valeria, who, when she heard that Princess
M&mdash;&mdash; was disposed to facilitate the escape of her lover
to Switzerland and thence to the United States, where
he could remain until after the war, when things would
have blown over, insisted on accompanying him into
exile. It was at Zurich that the romantic couple found
their first hiding-place, arranged with Count von G&mdash;&mdash;'s
usual genius for intrigue.</p>

<p>But the Austrian Court was on the watch.</p>

<p>The plan so astutely arranged by Princess M&mdash;&mdash; had
saved Count Seilern from the condemnation which hung
over his head. Unfortunately, the hatred of the Hapsburgs
and the vengeance of Conrad von Hoetzendorf
followed him to Switzerland.</p>

<p>Whilst at Zurich, Count Seilern frequently received
messages from Princess M&mdash;&mdash;, who, with her love for
adventures of this sort, began to take more and more
interest in the welfare of the couple, who had come to
be known by Count von G&mdash;&mdash;'s cynical phrase of "the
turtle-doves." There was hardly an occasion on which
the Imperial messenger left Vienna with diplomatic correspondence
for that cunning official but he carried confidential
letters for both the Count and the Archduchess.</p>

<p>I have often wondered whether Seilern, living happily
in his retirement at Zurich and looking forward to the
still more free life of the United States, ever realized
the tremendous hatred he had aroused against him. Probably
not, judging by his trustful attitude and what followed.
He appears, as far as I have been able to learn,
to have been so wrapped up in himself and his Archduchess
that he had not the slightest suspicion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
snare which the Austrian Court had determined to set
for him.</p>

<p>This, then, was what happened, according to Baron
A&mdash;&mdash;, to whom I owe the rest of this narrative.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;THE HYPOCRITICAL DIPLOMATIST SETS
DEATH TRAP</p>

<p>Von G&mdash;&mdash;, in spite of his scrupulous care to avoid
incriminating evidence of complicity with Princess M&mdash;&mdash;,
soon discovered the danger of "running with the hare
and hunting with the hounds," and accordingly made his
choice. I strongly suspect that pressure was brought to
bear upon him and that, in order not to lose his post,
and at the same time to gain favour at Court, he was
obliged to give his assistance to the Hapsburg and
Hoetzendorf parties, which had made up their minds to
punish severely the man who had dared to turn an Archduchess
from her duties and to set military laws at defiance.
So he entered without delay on his double game.</p>

<p>On the one hand, as the friend of Princess M&mdash;&mdash;,
he assured Seilern, through Baron A&mdash;&mdash;, of his earnest
desire to assist him in high flight by procuring him the
means of leaving for America. But, on the other, this
hypocritical diplomatist set to work to devise a plan for
enticing him on to Austrian soil&mdash;that is to say, on to
premises which, having been rented at Lucerne by the
Austrian Legation, would be considered as benefiting, in
the eyes of the Swiss authorities, by the valuable privilege
of ex-territoriality. A plan of this duplicity was
truly after the heart of such a man. If successfully carried
out, he knew it would inevitably lead to him being
regarded as an Austrian diplomat <i>de la meilleure race</i>&mdash;as
he himself would have expressed it.</p>

<p>I must now introduce to you a new character, a sincere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
friend of Count Seilern&mdash;an Englishman, Professor
S&mdash;&mdash;, who, in ignorance of Count von G&mdash;&mdash;'s duplicity,
and responding solely to the generosity of his heart, unknowingly
lent himself to the plot which was on foot.
Before he is actually brought upon the scene, however,
let me explain that von G&mdash;&mdash; had rented, at Lucerne, the
annex of an hotel, where, a short time afterwards,
Count von Bülow was to install his offices. Coinciding
with this, the Archduchess Valeria's brother, who, by
the way, is completely under the influence of the Court,
arrived and took up his quarters at the hotel in question.</p>

<p>Von G&mdash;&mdash;, still professing to be the friend of all parties,
then transmitted to Count Seilern, through his English
friend and professor, an invitation to come to Lucerne
for a short time, so as to receive the passports necessary
for traveling without let or hindrance to the United
States.</p>

<p>Thereupon the Archduchess Valeria, Count Seilern,
and their friend and counsellor, Baron A&mdash;&mdash;, left for
that resort, and took up their residence at an hotel. The
morning after their arrival, Seilern was requested to
come to the annex rented by the Austro-Hungarian
Legation. He was received there by the Minister Plenipotentiary,
Count von G&mdash;&mdash;, the Archduchess Valeria's
brother, the military attaché von E&mdash;&mdash;, and a number
of other unknown individuals, who, in reality, were members
of the secret police of Vienna.</p>

<p>What happened? You may judge from what follows.</p>

<p>The same day, his English friend, Professor S&mdash;&mdash;,
quietly continuing his work at Zurich, and under the
impression that he would be hearing in a few days of the
safe departure of the Count and Archduchess for the
United States, thanks to the "noble support" of the
Austro-Hungarian Minister, received a telegram worded
as follows: "Come to Lucerne immediately."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>At the railway station of the celebrated resort he was
met by two agents of the Austrian secret police, who
begged him, on behalf of Count von G&mdash;&mdash;, to accompany
them to the annex of the hotel rented by the Legation.
On the way they explained that Count von G&mdash;&mdash; had
sent for him "to see his friend, who had had an accident."
That was all the information he could extract
from them.</p>

<p>Mounting to the first floor, a door was thrown open
before him. In the middle of the room he saw a bed
and on it a body&mdash;that of the hapless Count Seilern, who
had been <i>condemned to death and executed</i> (though his
decease was attributed in the newspapers to suicide) for
having loved an Austrian Princess and threatened General
von Hoetzendorf!</p>

<p>As in the case of the Archduke Rudolf of Hapsburg,
at Mayerling, the body of the man who dared to "play
with fire" was covered up to the neck with white cloth,
with flowers strewn all over his deathbed.</p>

<p>This was in January, 1915.</p>

<p>Thus, the tradition of assassination is perpetuated from
one end to the other of the reign of the sinister Emperor
who sold the independence of his kingdom to William
II. of Germany. The victims change, but the methods
remain the same. Whosoever is considered guilty of an
offence against the "dignity" or "honour" of the Hapsburgs
must die, unless he or she consents to be declared
insane. Crime follows crime, and the family which, in
the eyes of the aged Emperor Francis Joseph himself, is
"doomed to be tracked by tragedy" knows, as in the
Middle Ages, but one argument against its enemies&mdash;the
knife and the bullet.</p>

<p>But what of the Archduchess Valeria? The last news
I heard of her was to the effect that, half-demented by
the shock she sustained, she lay for months between life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and death. On recovering, she turned her back for ever
on the fashionable life of Vienna, and withdrew to one
of her estates in the country, where she seeks what consolation
she can find in charitable work in her religion.</p>

<h2>TURNING HEAVENS INTO HELL&mdash;EXPLOITS
OF CANADIAN
FLYING CORPS</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Battle in Air With One Hundred Aeroplanes</i><br />
<br />
<i>Told by Officer of Royal Canadian Flying Corps</i>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>The heroism of the Canadians is one of the immortal epics of
the War. The great dominion sent across the seas her strongest
sons. Their valor in trench and field "saved the British army"
on many critical moments. The feats of daring of these Canadians
would fill many volumes, but here is one story typical of
their sublime courage&mdash;a tale of the air.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;WITH THE CANADIANS IN THE CLOUDS</p>

<p>There were one hundred of us&mdash;fifty on a side&mdash;but
we turned the heavens into a hell, up in the air there,
more terrible than ten thousand devils could have made
running rampant in the pit.</p>

<p>The sky blazed and crackled with bursting time bombs,
and the machine guns spitted out their steel venom, while
underneath us hung what seemed like a net of fire, where
shells from the Archies, vainly trying to reach us, were
bursting.</p>

<p>We had gone out early in the morning, fifty of us,
from the Royal Canadian Flying Corps barracks, back
of the lines, when the sun was low and my courage
lower, to bomb the Prussian trenches before the infantry
should attack.</p>

<p>Our machines were stretched out across a flat tableland.
Here and there in little groups the pilots were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
receiving instructions from their commander and consulting
maps and photographs.</p>

<p>At last we all climbed into our machines. All along
the line engines began to roar and sputter. Here was
a 300 horsepower Rolls-Royce, with a mighty, throbbing
voice; over there a $10,000 Larone rotary engine vieing
with the others in making a noise. Then there were the
little fellows humming and spitting the "vipers" or
"maggots," as they are known in the service.</p>

<p>At last the squadron commander took his place in his
machine and rose with a whirr. The rest of us rose and
circled round, getting our formation.</p>

<p>Crack! At the signal from the commander's pistol we
darted forward, going ever higher and higher, while the
cheers of the mechanicians and riggers grew fainter.</p>

<p>Across our own trenches we sailed and out over No
Man's Land, like a huge, eyeless, pock-scarred earth face
staring up at us.</p>

<p>There was another signal from the commander. Down
we swooped. The bomb racks rattled as hundreds of
bombs were let loose, and a second later came the crackle
of their explosions over the heads of the Boches in their
trenches.</p>

<p>Lower and lower we flew. We skimmed the trenches
and sprayed bullets from our machine guns. The crashing
of the weapons drowned the roar of the engines.</p>

<p>I saw ahead of me a column of flame shoot up from
one of our machines, and I caught a momentary glance at
the pilot's face. It was greenish-ash color. His petrol
tank had been hit. I hope the fall killed him and that
he did not burn to death.</p>


<p>II&mdash;THE VULTURES OVER THE TRENCHES</p>

<p>Away in the distance a number of specks had risen,
like vultures scenting the carrion that had already been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
made. It was a German squadron. The Archies had
not bothered us much while we were spraying the Prussian
trenches, but now we had that other squadron to
take care of. Our orders were to bomb the trenches.
We could not spare a bomb or a cartridge from the
task of putting the fear of Britain into the hearts of the
infantry below before our own "Tommies" should start
over the top.</p>

<p>I don't know what it was, but suddenly, just after
my partner had let go a rack of bombs, there was a
terrific explosion just beneath us. My machine leaped
upward, twisted, then dropped suddenly. Death himself
was trying to wrench the control levers from my grip,
but I clung to them madly and we righted. A few inches
more and I couldn't have told you about this.</p>

<p>There was no longer any chance to worry about flying
position. There were too many things occupying my
attention&mdash;that line of gray down there that we were
trying to erase and the Boche squadron thrumming down
on us.</p>

<p>One drum of our ammunition was already used up.
My partner whirled around on his stool&mdash;a sort of piano
stool, which always made me think of the tuneless, tinpanny
instrument back in quarters&mdash;grabbed another
drum and slammed it into the machine gun. It was to be
a parting message for the Prussians, for the commander
was just signalling to retire.</p>

<p>My partner lurched forward. He was hit. A thin red
stream trickled down his face.</p>

<p>I raced westward, the air whistling through the bullet
holes in the wings of the machine and my partner leaning
against the empty bomb rack, silent.</p>

<p>As we sailed over the foremost Prussian trench some
Scotch were just leaping into it. The "ladies from hell"
the Germans call them, because of their kilts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Several machines had landed before I took the ground.
Ambulances were dashing back and forth across the flying
field.</p>

<p>They lifted my partner out of the aeroplane, but they
did not put him into an ambulance. He had answered
another recall. I walked to quarters ill&mdash;ill at heart, at
stomach, at mind. I'll never know a better pal than was
Tom.</p>

<p>On the way I managed to help with a machine that
had just landed. A big Rolls-Royce it was, and the
radiator had been hit by a bit of shrapnel. The pilot
and observer were both terribly scalded.</p>

<p>Just by the aerodrome another biplane fluttered down.
The observer was dead. The pilot was hit in a dozen
places. Somehow he brought the machine in, switched
off his engine and slopped forward in his seat, stone dead.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later I was sound asleep. The next day
we were at it again.</p>

<p>In battles of this kind it is more or less a matter of
good fortune if you escape with your life. Flying ability
and trickiness can play but little part. It is in the lone
adventure that stunt flying helps.</p>


<p>III&mdash;THE MYSTERIOUS MAJOR AND THE
UHLANS</p>

<p>One of the most versatile flyers in the corps was the
"Mysterious Major." Condon was his name, but to all
the men, both sides of No Man's Land, he was the
"Mysterious Major."</p>

<p>He was forced to glide to earth one day, back of the
Prussian lines, with his big motor stalled. He leaped out
hastily, adjusted a bit of machinery and spun the propellers.
A gentle purr, then silence, was the response.</p>

<p>Once more he flashed the blades around, with no better
result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>It wasn't a healthy neighborhood to be in. With a
short, crisp oath, the "Mysterious Major" set to work in
dead earnest. Down the road to the right of the field a
cloud of dust, flying high, appeared. It meant cavalry.
The major's ears caught the sound of hoofbeats.</p>

<p>It was tradition that he would never be killed in the
air, but here he was on earth, with cavalry galloping
toward him. His descent had probably been spotted and
the Uhlans sent to get him.</p>

<p>At last he got a roar from the engine that sounded
like business, but it petered out.</p>

<p>Closer came the hoof beats. The Uhlans rode over a
fence and came galloping across the field. A shot punctuated
his exhortations to the motor and slit one of the
planes.</p>

<p>Pulling and tugging, he got his machine turned so that
he could use his machine gun. Br-r-rang! He let drive
a drum of ammunition from his machine gun. He saw
several horses and riders go down in sprawling, rolling
heaps, then turned to his motor again.</p>

<p>Eight or ten Uhlans who had escaped his murderous
fire withdrew. He knew what they would do. They
would return from every side at once, and his single
machine gun could never stop them.</p>

<p>If he could only get into the air he would feel safe.
Once more he twisted the propeller. As though nothing
had ever been wrong, the engine started to thrum and
roar. He leaped into the seat.</p>

<p>Quickly the machine rose. The Uhlans saw it. I suppose
they knew he had not loaded the machine gun again,
and they galloped on to the field, firing at him.</p>

<p>He was so low that there was every chance for them to
hit his petrol tank or even the major himself. So he
went even lower. Straight at the heads of the horses he
drove. The animals, scared at the great, white-winged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
roaring machine, reared and plunged, throwing some of
the riders to the ground. The others were too busy with
their mounts to shoot straight.</p>

<p>The major waved goodby, fired a couple of parting
shots from his service revolver and climbed to where
the bullets could not reach him. It was not his fate to
die in the air, he thought, but only a few weeks after
he told me this story he was killed by a shrapnel burst
from an Archie, which wrecked his machine while he was
flying with an air patrol.</p>

<p>I do not think they ever should have sent him on
such work. He was too valuable alone. The Prussians
feared him so much that a price was upon his head.</p>

<p>Scarcely a day went by that some new feat of daring
was not accredited to this almost phantom-like flier. Perhaps
he did not perform them all, but the effect was
cumulative.</p>

<p>I have known the "Mysterious Major" to side slip three
thousand feet at a time. He used to skim so close to
the Boche trenches that they say men ducked their heads,
and all the time he was pouring six hundred shots a
minute from his machine gun.</p>

<p>Many said the "Mysterious Major" was crazy, but if
we all were suffering from the same dementia the Boches
wouldn't be able to show their heads. He was of inestimable
value to the secret service, but those stories will
have to wait until after the war, if they are ever told.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;THE BIRDMAN WHO PLAYED 'POSSUM</p>

<p>One of the most thrilling encounters I can recall is
that of Captain Woodhouse, who, accompanied by another
pilot, was out over the Prussian lines. One of the
Prussians gave chase and opened fire. Woodhouse made
believe that he had been hit, and his companion brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the machine down in a field. Immediately the Prussian,
in one of the latest type battle planes, made his landing
and went over to the other machine without bothering
to cover the pilot with his revolver, Woodhouse meanwhile
lying as if dead. Suddenly he leaped up, jammed
his revolver under the Boche's nose and marched him
over to the big battle plane, got in after him and with
the gun against his ribs took him back to our lines, a
prisoner. Later he returned and got the Prussian machine.
Besides the machine there were some valuable
papers taken, which proved very useful later.</p>

<p>In the Royal Naval Air Service there is a young lieutenant,
Murray Galbraith by name, with whom I once
trained at the school at Dayton, Ohio. Murray is a great
big fellow who gave up a splendid future&mdash;his father is
one of the Canadian silver kings&mdash;to go into the flying
service. He was sent to Dunkirk to do patrol work for
one of the monitors lying off the coast. Over at Ostend
the Prussians had made their staff headquarters in a
certain hotel. Galbraith spotted this hotel and directed
the shell-fire of the monitor with such accuracy that the
Prussian staff barely escaped annihilation.</p>

<p>On one of his flights over the Prussian lines he encountered
five machines, one of which he disposed of. He
got away from the rest and, coming on toward the
Somme, ran into another group of Boches. Two of
these he put out of business with a withering fire from
his Lewis gun and then executed a loop and started earthward.
His engine gave out, but he was just high enough
to glide back over their lines and then to a point of
safety near our lines.</p>

<p>When he landed his machine was literally shot to
pieces. He received the D. S. O. for this and, I believe,
has since been decorated again. (Retold from <i>New York
Herald</i>.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tales of the Great War bring stories of thousands of women
fighting as soldiers in men's uniforms on all the battle-lines&mdash;in
the trenches, in the artillery and cavalry, and going "over the
top" in the bayonet charges. "The Legion of Death"&mdash;a battalion
of Russian women, under command of Vera Butchkaroff,
has fought many hard battles with the Russian Army. They are
pledged to take their own lives rather than become prisoners of
the Germans, who have ravished and attacked them. Each
woman soldier carries a ration of cyanide of potassium to be
swallowed in case of capture. Mme. Colonel Koudasheva commands
the Sixth Ural Cossacks, of which one-fourth of the
soldiers are women. The Serbian, German and Austrian women
are in the ranks. Official dispatches mention them for orders of
bravery. A few of these stories are told in these pages from
the following sources: I&mdash;War Correspondent of <i>New York

<p>I&mdash;STORIES OF MADAM COLONEL
KOUDASHEVA</p>

<p>It did not seem possible that women could undergo the
hardships, the complete reversal of all their habits and
the primitive manners that necessarily accompany trench
life. Incredulity has, however, given way before actual
official reports of women decorated and promoted for
bravery on the battlefields. It seems now that in Europe
the women actually do put on the uniform of the men,
fight not only in trenches, but in the cavalry, and in every
way measure up to the standard of a soldier.</p>

<p>Indeed, they are harder to conquer, it seems, than the
men. A recent semi-official report from Petrograd mentioned
that the Russians were surprised, when they captured
a line of trenches along the Bzura River in Poland,
to find a number of German women among their captives.
These women were found in the very first line, with hot
rifles still in their hands.</p>

<p>"There was much more difficulty in making these
women prisoners than the men," reported the officer in
charge of the victors. "They would not surrender until
after all their men comrades had thrown down their arms,
and they taunted the men with cowardice. These women
were not at all heavy, unsexed peasants. Some of them
showed the marks of refinement. Inquiry developed
that only a few had donned the uniform because some
loved one was in their company. The majority had
enlisted because of pure patriotism.</p>

<p>"I was told that the German authorities," said the
officer in charge of the victors, "do not openly encourage
enlistment by women, but they do wink at it. The men in
the trenches, the officers know perfectly well that this
and that soldier is a woman, but they pretend not to know
it officially."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The Russians could not have been surprised at seeing
women soldiers, however, because hundreds of women are
apparently fighting in the armies of the Czar.</p>

<p>Mme. Alexandra Koudasheva is the most distinguished
woman soldier in the Russian army. She commands the
Sixth Ural Cossack Regiment, which has covered itself
with honors in many battles in East Prussia. Wounded
twice, Mme. Koudasheva bears the Cross of St. George,
that is given only for exceptional bravery, and many
orders of inferior significance. She is back again to her
regiment which consists of many Cossack woman volunteers,
though the majority of the soldiers are men. A
few more successful battles and Mme. Koudasheva will
be promoted to a general.</p>

<p>When the war began Mme. Koudasheva entered the
army as a volunteer. She distinguished herself in daring
raids on the German Uhlans, and was made a lieutenant,
and soon thereafter a colonel of the same regiment
in which her husband had served two years ago.
During the two months that she has acted as a commander
of the regiment she has given proof of exceptional
strategic gifts and courage. She has never stood
behind, but always in front, of her men. Naturally, no
man likes to be surpassed by a woman, and this has given
her company a reputation for unusual bravery.</p>

<p>Colonel Koudasheva is by no means a semi-barbaric
adventurer or a Salome who revels in bloodshed. She is
a lady of highest culture and refinement. Besides being
a talented poet and brilliant writer, she is a fine musician
and a passionate lover of sports. She has made twice a
trip on horseback from China, through Manchuria,
Siberia and European Russia to Petrograd. She made the
trip alone, and passed the most dangerous deserts of the
two continents without having had any great difficulties.</p>

<p>"I have felt just as safe in the wildest deserts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Siberia, as I do in the streets of Moscow or Petrograd,
simply because I have absolute confidence in my ability to
command the man, regardless do I meet him in a fashionable
society of a big city, or as a highway robber in
the wildest wilds. A woman&mdash;if she only knows her
feminine powers&mdash;can conquer any man," thus writes
Mme. Koudasheva in her "Diary of Ride Through
Siberia."</p>

<p>This is how she writes in a letter to a friend in New
York of one of her adventures while she was still a lieutenant
and was out to ascertain the strength of the enemy
at night:</p>

<p>"It was a ghastly moonlight night of the Fall. A
bleak wind whistled and howled around the ruins of the
village, in which there had been so much human joy
before and so much misery after. I was riding with a
company of twenty-five men to trace the retreating
enemy. Though the amphitheatric hills that rose before
us seemed dead and bare, yet mysterious flashes of light
appeared here and there, like magic signals. They warned
us of the hidden batteries of the enemy. As we galloped
on, I could see the road strewn with broken boxes, knapsacks,
household implements, dead horses and men which
the enemy had left behind in his hurried retreat.</p>

<p>"'Excellency,' whispered my orderly, I see there
beyond the hill a moving dot. It's probably the head of a
"dady"' (as we called the Germans). As we were in
the shadow of the ruins, we could discern distinctly the
bare field in the moonlight. Before us was the first line
of the trenches of the enemy. I pulled my rifle and
aimed. A shot. The dot became a black figure that rose
and staggered and fell. It was a distance of 150 steps,
and I could see how a gray ribbon of trenches stretched
in both directions before us&mdash;a ribbon that always fascinates
and yet frightens because it is the home of death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
More black dots were visible, moving in the direction
where the one before had fallen.</p>

<p>"Little by little I could see dots in every direction
beyond the ribbon. A few figures climbed out and started
running toward us. 'One, two, three!' I whispered and
then followed a salvo from my men. The figures either
fell or ran back behind the ribbon. From behind a hill
flashed a light and then the battery of the enemy opened
fire at the village where we were. It was the machine
guns. 'Nu-ka, Misha, tickle the dadies, quick!' was the
humorous remark of one of my soldiers to me. We
must have killed and wounded a hundred or more. Then
we turned around and rode away, without having lost a
single man and without having any men wounded."</p>

<p>Mme. Koudasheva is a student of soldier psychology
on the battlefield, as is shown in another letter.</p>

<p>"When you feel the invisible fingers of fate so close
to your life, as on the battlefield, the problems that interest
you before and the feelings that you experience in a
peaceful feminine activity die out and a new view opens.
It is not the feeling of sport, it is not the feeling of
being killed, that takes hold of the mind of the battlefield,
but it is a queer, dramatic hypnose, like an actor
feels before opening a play.</p>

<p>"It all seems a huge cosmic play&mdash;a stern tragic panorama
of life&mdash;but still a play. The whole human organism
seems to work against all laws of nature, for, though
you stay in the cold and rain day and night, yet you catch
no cold, no ailments that are usual in everyday life."</p>

<p>Mme. Colonel Koudasheva may require a strict discipline
of her inferiors, but she never applies any punitive
measures. She commands with the most polite
words. "Gentlemen, please, would you do me the favor"
is her usual command to the soldiers. "My boys and
girls go to any fire without any forcible measures," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
writes. "I just need to hint at an instruction, and already
it is carried out. I have taught them not to shoot with
hate, but to love the man they shoot. And they do love,
which is proven by an incident when once we chased
the enemy into river and when we saw that they would
be drowned we all went to pull them out, and thus saved a
whole company."</p>

<p>Another Russian heroine is Natalie Tychnini, a high
school girl of Kier, who has received the decoration of
the Order of St. George for distinguished service at the
front. She had arrived at Opatow among a detachment
of volunteers for the campaign against the Austrians.
She was dressed like a man, and passed for a
remarkably handsome boy. She was detailed to carry
ammunition to the trenches. She was in the hottest fire
and was wounded twice. The Russians were forced to
retire, and she was left lying on the field.</p>

<p>The Austrian Red Cross workers found her.</p>

<p>"Why, this is a woman!" exclaimed the Austrian surgeon
who examined her. The Austrians nursed her.
When the Russians again took Opatow she was still in
a hospital. She was recaptured by them and sent back
to Kier, where she was given her honors.</p>

<p>Austrian women are also fighting. Stefa Falica is a
young Croatian who enlisted with her husband in the
same regiment. In this case her sex was well-known,
and she was not forced to use men's clothes. She has
already been made a corporal for her bravery in the
field.</p>

<p>A similar case is that of Stanislawa Ordinska, who
enlisted, masquerading as a man, in the Polish Legion
of Austria. She was made a sergeant for bravery shown
at the front before it was discovered she was a woman.
Then she was allowed to keep her rank and her gun.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting bodies of women soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
is the Serbian organization called the "Legia Smirti," or
Legion of Death.</p>

<p>The Legion of Death is composed of women who have
been trained in the use of firearms and in the science of
war. In the Balkan States, where women frequently
follow their husbands throughout military campaigns,
acting as pack-carriers, camp-attendants, and even as
trench-diggers and sappers when necessary, it is not unusual
for them to take their places beside their husbands
or their lovers on the firing line. There are many expert
rifle shots among them, many indeed who are capable of
taking men's places under necessity. Accustomed to
attack in solitary places, and more or less inured to bereavement,
a kind of grim quiet follows them wherever
they are seen.</p>

<p>The Legion of Death is recruited from all classes of
women, from the wives of rich merchants to the wives
and daughters of peasants. This Amazon corps had its
origin in the patriotic enthusiasm of a woman sixty-two
years old, whose husband died for Serbia in the war for
liberty against the Turks. The women handle the regulation
rifles and are held in deadly fear by the Austrians
and Germans.</p>

<p>Indeed, it seems that on both sides the soldiers dread
the women soldiers more than they do those of their
own sex.</p>

<p>Kipling's "The female of the species is more deadly
than the male," recalls itself, of course. Dr. Hans Hulduckson,
writing of this same phenomenon, said:</p>

<p>"Women are not natural combatants. They do not
rush into war for war's sake. They are without the
blood lust that makes fighting a joy for fighting's sake.
They will fight only in desperate straits, and then only
for their honor, their children or the existence of their
country. Standing at one of these last ditches, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
they fight with the ferocity of tigers. They do battle
without rule or reason and to the death. An Englishwoman,
who is endeavoring to organize a company of
women for military training, said that she did not fear
that they would not fight, but the fear was that they
might fight too fiercely. They are the most cruel of combatants
when they so far overcome their native womanly
gentleness as to enter into combat.</p>

<p>"A soldier of experience said that he would rather
fight a company of male soldiers than one woman soldier.
He explained that woman is too resourceful in the matter
of weapons. War transforms woman for the time into
a beast."</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF THE "POTASSIUM BRIGADE"</p>

<p>Russia's women soldiers have pledged themselves to
take their own lives rather than become German war
prisoners. Each woman soldier carries a ration of
cyanide of potassium to be swallowed in case of capture.</p>

<p>The members of the women regiments, now constantly
increasing, agreed that death was to be preferred to the
fate they would probably meet at the hands of the
Germans.</p>

<p>The "Legion of Death" fighters are "good killers." I
learned this to-day, when I talked to five of them now in
a hospital near here, suffering from shell shock. From
a woman's lips I heard how she had run a German
through with her bayonet, firing the rifle at the same time.
From others I heard how these women and girls, fresh
from comfortable homes and universities, went leaping
over mangled bodies in the charge with enemy shells
bursting all about them.</p>

<p>But these harrowing experiences of the women fighters
have steeled them and hundreds of other girls to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
new determination to see it through. Girl soldiers drilling
in the streets are now a common sight in Petrograd.
Huge crowds gather daily about the Engineers' School,
where 1,000 girls are drilling preparing to go to the
front. In Moscow 1,000 men are training, while Kieff
and Odessa have smaller bands. Premier Kerensky has
also authorized the formation of women marine detachments
and has promised to assign them to ships. The
new women commands attempt no sort of decoration.
Their heads are shaved and they wear the regulation uniform,
including the heavy, ugly army boots.</p>

<p>The five women fighters I visited at the hospital were
partially paralyzed by shell shock. One of them, a peasant
girl, smiled joyously as she pointed to a German
helmet on the bed beside her. It was the first war prize
of a Russian woman.</p>

<p>"I saw a German in front of me as I ran forward
with the others in the charge," she told me. "It was his
life or mine. I raised my rifle. I plunged with all my
strength. I stabbed him. The bayonet went deep into
his body. At the same moment I pulled the trigger. He
dropped dead. Then I took his hat as a souvenir."</p>

<p>The girl soldier smiled with delight.</p>

<p>"What was the battle like?" I asked another of the
legionnaires.</p>

<p>"I was very nervous just before the charge," she replied.
"We knew the order was coming and naturally
we were just a little scared. But as soon as the orders
to go forward came we forgot everything else in the
advance.</p>

<p>"I could hear our girls yelling and shouting throughout
the march forward. None of us were afraid once we
got started. We were in the midst of a great fusillade
of shots. Then terrific big shells began breaking all
around us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"We were again frightened a little when we first saw
dead men about, but before very long we were jumping
over the dead, and quickly forgot all about them."</p>

<p>"We couldn't tell what was going on anywhere," said
a third girl in describing the final stages of the battle.</p>

<p>"Commander Bochkoreva was everywhere, urging us
to fight and die like real Russian soldiers."</p>

<p>Then the girl told how the legion took its first prisoners.</p>

<p>"As we ran forward we suddenly came upon a bunch
of Germans immediately ahead of us. It was only a
second until we were all around them.</p>

<p>"They saw they were caught and threw down their
rifles, holding up their hands. They were terribly frightened.</p>

<p>"Good God! Women!" they exclaimed.</p>

<p>"We saw wounded German soldiers raising themselves
on their elbows and shooting," interjected another
wounded girl. "We just forgot ourselves entirely. We
were simply Russia, fighting for her life.</p>

<p>"The loss of Lena, the most popular member of our
company, was keenly felt by all of us," she added soberly.
"During the battle Lena heard that Commander Bochkoreva
had been killed. She hurried forward into the
shell and fire, saying she was going to find her. We saw
her go through one space literally strewn with exploding
shells. Then, through the smoke and flames, we saw
her blown to fragments.</p>

<p>"We also lost Sonia. She used to be a musician with
the Romanoff concert organization. She was killed by
machine gun fire."</p>

<p>Petrograd has not yet seen the full casualty list of the
Legion of Death. From what the girls say, however, it
appears that at least a dozen big shells struck square in
their midst, killing perhaps twelve girls and wounding
twice as many more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Five of the German prisoners the girls captured were
women, wearing the German soldier's uniform. The
number of women in all armies on the eastern front is
believed to be growing steadily.</p>

<p>As I returned from the hospital where I saw these
paralyzed girls I met a new company of women marching
briskly through the street. They were ready for the
firing line, ready to give their lives in battle, and with
their little ration of cyanide ready to take their own lives
to avoid worse than death at the hands of the enemy.</p>


<p>III&mdash;STORIES OF WOUNDED GIRLS IN
"COMMAND OF DEATH"</p>

<p>When the Russian women's battalion, known officially
as the "Command of Death," went into action against
the Germans near Smorgon, July 25, they captured a
number of German women who also were fighting on the
battle front in western Russia.</p>

<p>Ten wounded heroines of the women's battalion arrived
in Petrograd leaving their commander, Vera Butchkareff
and Marya Skrydloff, a daughter of Admiral Skrydloff,
former commander of the Baltic fleet, and minister of
marine, in a hospital at Vitebsk.</p>

<p>The women said it was reported that of the 200 of the
command who reached the front only fifty remained.
Twenty were killed, eight were taken prisoners and all
the rest were wounded.</p>

<p>"Several times," said one wounded girl, "we attacked
the Germans. Especially memorable was our attack at
Novospassky wood, near Smorgon, where the enemy,
hearing the voices of girls, lost their nerve. The result
was that the prisoners were a few women, from whom we
learned for the first time that German women also were
fighting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"We did not feel the slightest fear for our personal
safety. Our passion was to serve the fatherland. We
advanced gaily against the foe with laughter and song,
our only unpleasant sentiments being when we first came
to the corpses. Once when replying to the enemy's severe
rifle and machine gun fire, we discovered to our
amazement that all our men comrades in the neighboring
trenches had treacherously fled, leaving us&mdash;a handful
of women&mdash;to face the enemy alone."</p>

<p>The Russian women's battalion underwent the greatest
hardships, not only in the actual fighting, but on their way
to the front, according to stories told by wounded girls
who have been brought back from the fighting lines to be
placed in hospitals. Their heroism under fire was wonderful.
Their dash and elan and their fearlessness under
fire make a new chapter of the war.</p>

<p>The girls were sent to the front after they had demanded
of Premier Kerensky that they be allowed to go.</p>

<p>They had boarded a train of long striped cars. The
wooden bunks had been placed along the walls. The
journey had been long and tiresome. Word of the women
soldiers' coming had preceded them and they were greeted
by jeering and hooting crowds at every station along the
route.</p>

<p>The girls had their answers ready to the cries of the
station crowds.</p>

<p>"What do you think you're going to do?" the jeers
would go.</p>

<p>"Why are you fighting?"</p>

<p>Back would come the answer hot with scorn:</p>

<p>"Because you men are afraid to fight. All Russians are
not cowards."</p>

<p>The women were sent to a camp back of the lines on
the northern front. On their arrival there they were
hooted by the male soldiers, who later tried to force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
themselves into the women's camp. It was plain that the
men had no idea the women really expected to fight;
they believed them to be merely camp followers and their
cries showed as much. It was only when a band of male
soldiers had been driven from the women's quarters at
the bayonet point that they changed their view.</p>

<p>The girls drilled every day, rain or shine, and bathed
in a river near the camp. While half of the battalion
bathed the others had to maintain a strict guard to keep
the male soldiers away.</p>

<p>Then came weary days of waiting. The commanders
would not let the girls go to the front. It was only after
great influence had been used that the order sending them
to the trenches was given. They greeted the order with
cheers and in their first action advanced singing songs
of home. Their voices reached the German trenches and
the sound of women singing so surprised the defenders
that they were beaten back before they could regain
their composure. As a result a number of prisoners were
taken.</p>

<p>The women of the "Command of Death" came from
every branch and class of society. University students,
girls from some of the most noted families of Russia,
professional women, working women and peasants, all
were included in the membership.</p>

<p>"All we wanted was to help save the fatherland," said
a wounded girl. "Women have as much right at the
front as men. It is our country, too."</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORIES TOLD BY WOMEN AFTER THE
BATTLE</p>

<p>Only fifty of the whole battalion of women in Russia's
Legion of Death came through their first battle unscathed.
But the wounded as well as those who escaped are going
back to the front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Vera Butchkareff, commander of the Legion, suffering
from shell shock in a hospital, so declared as she proudly
told the heroic story of her unit's fighting. Half a dozen
other wounded women in the same hospital gave instant
corroboration.</p>

<p>"We have fought with men and with women," Commander
Butchkareff declared, "and one is as good as the
other if he or she loves the fatherland.</p>

<p>"My girls have been divided before the battle. One
half remained a unit under my command and the other
half were distributed in small detachments of six or ten
to various companies. These small units were to act as
ammunition carriers only. My half was an active fighting
force. I led them into the charge myself."</p>

<p>"We are all going back to the front," one of the girls
declared. The whole roomful of wounded Legionnaires
chorused instant approval.</p>

<p>"The German girls we captured carried a sign 'Send
us your women; we will pay you well,'" declared one of
the girl soldiers.</p>

<p>"They sent us&mdash;but we carried bayonets," she added.</p>

<p>The girls are for the most part between eighteen and
thirty years of age. Some of the force are married
women with children and a few are of middle age.
Among these latter a striking figure is Mme. Sofie Vansa,
widow of a colonel killed in battle and whose two sons
are now lying wounded.</p>

<p>Mary Goloubyova, the eighteen-year-old high-school
girl who was wounded, tells this story:</p>

<p>"We went into action a fortnight after our arrival at
the front under heavy German cannon fire. Given the
order to advance, we rushed out of our trench. Feeling
no sense of danger, we dashed toward the enemy in the
wood. The machine guns began knocking over my companions.
We were ordered to lie down. I noticed those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
at the front with me were all women. The men were
further back.</p>

<p>"I began shooting, the gun kicking my shoulder so
hard that it is still blue and stiff. I was glad when we
were ordered to charge the machine guns in the woods.
We paid dearly, but we held on, and by night our scouts
discovered the machine gunners and we shelled them out.</p>

<p>"After the first attack I was attached to a machine gun,
carrying ammunition to an advanced position under the
fire of hidden German machine guns. We were advancing
and constantly in danger of capture by the Germans.
On one trip over newly captured ground I saw what I
considered a wounded German officer lying on the
ground. I went to help him with my gun in my right
hand and the machine-gun ammunition in my left.</p>

<p>"Seeing this, he jumped to his knees and pulled out his
revolver, but before he could shoot I dropped the ammunition
and killed him. How did I feel on taking a human
life? I had no sensation except to rid my country of an
enemy. There was no sentimentality. We were trying
to kill them and they were trying to kill us&mdash;that is all.
Any Russian girl or any American girl in the same position
would have the same feeling."</p>


<p>V&mdash;VISIT TO THE WOMEN SOLDIERS'
BARRACKS</p>

<p>In the history of new Russia, as it will be written for
posterity, will stand out one bright, flaming spot&mdash;the
gallant stand of the Women's Regiment&mdash;the "Command
of Death"&mdash;in the midst of an ebbing wave of cowardly,
panic-stricken men units. For pure courage and coolness
the action of the Butchkareff detachment near Vilna on
that terrible July day has seldom been equaled....</p>

<p>The barracks of the command is in Torgvay Street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Posted at the gate was a little blue-eyed sentry in a soldier's
khaki blouse, short breeches, green forage-cap,
woman's ordinary black stockings, and neat, heavily soled
shoes. The sentry was Miss Mary Skrydloff, daughter
of the former commander of the Baltic Fleet and Minister
of Marine. The Skrydloff family is one of the oldest
and most distinguished in Russia.</p>

<p>Inside there were four large dormitories, the beds
without bedding and heavy overcoats flung over them.
In the courtyard 300 girls were at drill, mostly between
eighteen and twenty-five years of age and of good physique
and most of them pretty and refined in appearance.
They wore their hair short or their heads entirely shaved.
They were being drilled under the direction of a male
sergeant of the Volynsky Regiment, a famous Russian
military organization, and were marching in an exaggerated
goose step.</p>

<p>Commander Vera Butchkareff explained that most of
the recruits were from the higher educational academies
and secondary schools, with a few peasants, factory girls,
and servants. The commander said:</p>

<p>"We apply the rigid system of the army before the days
of the revolution, rejecting the new principle of soldier
self-government. Having no time to inure the girls gradually
to hardships, we impose a Spartan régime from the
first. They sleep on boards, without bed-clothes, thus
immediately eliminating the weak and those who require
comforts. The smallest breach of discipline is punished
with immediate and dishonorable discharge.</p>

<p>"The ordinary food of the soldier is furnished by the
guards equipage corps. We arise at four and drill daily
from five to eleven and from one to six. The girls carry
the cavalry carbine, which is five pounds lighter than the
regulation infantry rifle. On our first parade I requested
those whose motives were frivolous to step aside. Only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
one did so. Later on, however, many who were unable
to stand the privations of a soldier-life left us.</p>

<p>"We are fully official and are already entered on the
lists of Russia's regiments. Uniforms and supplies are
received from the Ministry of War, to which we render
accounts and present reports. Yesterday the commander
of the Petrograd district reviewed us and expressed great
satisfaction. I am convinced that we will excel the male
fighters, once we get into action."</p>

<p>Commander Butchkareff said that only the Volynsky,
which had provided the drill-sergeant, was really favorable.
The Volynsky Regiment was the unit which led the
Russian revolution. The regimental clerk is Mme. Barbara
Bukovishkoff, the author of several admirable short
stories.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;STORY OF COMMANDER VERA
BUTCHKAREFF</p>

<p>Mme. Butchkareff is of peasant origin. Vera Butchkareff,
or simply Yashka, as she has been christened by
the men of the regiment to which she belonged, got much
of her warlike spirit from her father, who fought through
the whole of the Turkish war and was left a cripple for
life. Her mother was a hard-working woman, with five
children, of whom Yashka was the eldest, and she had
to go out washing and cooking to earn enough to clothe
and feed this flock.</p>

<p>At the age of five Yashka was sent out as nurse to a
baby of three. And from that time she has never stopped
working. She looks none the worse for it. Finely yet
strongly built, with broad shoulders and healthy complexion,
she can lift 200 pounds with the greatest of ease.
She has never known what fear is.</p>

<p>Not long ago she remarked that during the last two
years she had lived through so much that there remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
but one danger yet to experience, that of flying. Just as
she was saying that an aviator came up and offered to take
her for a flight, and before the day was out she had
exhausted her list of perils.</p>

<p>When she was sixteen years old her parents seized the
first opportunity of getting her married. She never knew
the man, but luckily as time wore on they grew very
fond of each other, and were very happy. At first they
both served in a shop, and thanks to their perseverance
and frugality they were soon able to open a small shop
of their own. But just as they began to prosper the war
broke out, and he was one of the first to be called up.</p>

<p>She was very keen on accompanying him as a soldier,
but he begged her to stay behind and work for her parents,
whom they had been keeping.</p>

<p>She was always ready for any daring venture, and it
was with great reluctance that she stayed at home in compliance
with her husband's wish. Time passed, and after
long waiting she got the news that he had been killed in
action on May 28, 1915. At once she went to her parents,
and said: "I have decided to go to the front, and
you will either hear of my death or I shall return to you
in honor and glory. I trust in God." And no persuasions
were of any use.</p>

<p>For two years she has lived in the trenches and fought
like a man. She has been wounded three times&mdash;in her
arm, leg, and back. In the Lake Naroch battles there
was a time when all the officers were killed and the men
lost courage and lay down, too frightened to attack. Then
she rose up and dashed forward calling on them to follow
her. Every one obeyed her.</p>

<p>(Many are the tales that will be told of these women
soldiers in the "New Russia," but this is sufficient to prove
that womanhood the world over always rises to the emergency
when home or country are in danger.)</p>

<h2>THE TALE OF THE "TARA" OFF
THE AFRICAN COAST</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Rescued by "Tanks in the Desert"</i><br />
<br />
<i>As told by survivors, set down by Lewis R. Freeman</i>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>The adventures of the crew of the auxiliary cruiser, <i>Tara</i>,
torpedoed off the North African coast, form one of the most
exciting and romantic chapters in the annals of the Great War.
Handed over as prisoners to the fanatical Senussi Arabs, they
were taken out into the heart of the desert, where for many
weary months they were on the brink of starvation, eking out
their scanty ration of rice with snails and roots. The captain
escaped and tried to bring help, but was captured and brought
back to be lashed and kept without food. Just when things
were at their worst a squadron of British armored cars, commanded
by the Duke of Westminster, appeared as though by
magic, drove off the Arabs, and rescued the survivors of the
sorely-tried crew. By courtesy of the Admiralty the author
interviewed Captain Gwatkin-Williams, the <i>Tara's</i> commander;
Lieutenant Tanner, R.N.R., and several members of the ship's
company, and their stories give a vivid idea of the terrible
experience they underwent, as told in the <i>Wide World Magazine</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE BRITISH PACKET</p>

<p>When England took over something like half of her
twenty million tons of merchant shipping for war service,
among the transports, colliers, hospital ships, and the
like were a number of small but swift packets which were
armed and employed as auxiliary cruisers or patrols.
One of these was the <i>Tara</i>, which, under the name <i>Hibernia</i>,
had plied in the Irish service of the London and
North-Western Railway. Commanded by an officer of
the Royal Navy, but still worked by her old crew, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
<i>Tara</i> was sent to the bleak Cyrenaican coast of the Mediterranean
to keep a look-out for submarines and prevent
the smuggling of arms and supplies to the small but dangerous
Turkish forces which were operating in Eastern
Tripolitana with the object of inciting the Arabs to move
against the then lightly-held western frontier of Egypt.</p>

<p>On November 5th the <i>Tara</i> was torpedoed by a German
submarine in the Gulf of Sollum, and sank with the
loss of eleven of her crew of something over one hundred.
The ninety-two survivors were towed by the submarine
to Port Sulieman and handed over to the Turks.
The latter, in turn, passed the party on to the Senussi,
who, as shortly transpired, were getting ready to launch
a "holy war" against the Italians and English. The
Arabs, short of food already, started marching their
prisoners about the desert, and after several weeks established
them in a sort of permanent camp at an old
Roman well in the interior. Here, ekeing out with snails
and roots such scanty rations as their captors were able
to provide, the unfortunate Britons, racked by disease,
and only half sheltered from the capricious winter
weather, existed for three months and a half. The
trickle of food, now from one oasis, now from another,
became thinner and thinner as time went on, and by the
middle of March the failure of supplies had become so
complete that absolute starvation in the course of the next
few days appeared inevitable. But on the seventeenth
of that month, as suddenly as though dropped from the
sky, a squadron of armored automobiles appeared on the
horizon, and a few moments later the Arab guards had
fallen before the fire of machine-guns, and the half-delirious
prisoners, clutching hastily-broached jam and
condensed milk tins, were being bundled into Red Cross
ambulances for the return journey. A couple of days
more, and they were in the hospitals of Alexandria, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
a month later the bulk of them were back in England reporting
for duty.</p>

<p>Through the courtesy of the British Admiralty the
writer was granted an extended interview with Captain
Gwatkin-Williams&mdash;the only one, indeed, that that distinguished
officer gave before going to his new command
in the North Atlantic. Later I journeyed to Wales and
Ireland, to talk with Lieutenant Tanner, R.N.R., and
several of the surviving members of the <i>Tara's</i> crew.
The narrative that follows is the result of these conversations.</p>

<p>I recognized Captain Gwatkin-Williams the instant his
broad shoulders filled the door of the room. I knew at
once that he had all the characteristics, as he had all the
appearance, of the typical British naval officer, and that
among these was a distinct disinclination to tell of his own
experiences. Knowing from past failures the futility of
trying to "draw" a man of his kind by frontal attack,
I wasted no effort in that direction, but asked him pointblank
if he had been able to preserve any souvenirs of
his desert sojourn, and it is by piecing together the things
he told me over a brine-blotched naval uniform, a dented
jam tin, a handful of snail-shells and dried roots, three
or four camel-bone needles, and a blood-stained whip
of hippo hide, that I was able to construct the connected
story which follows.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was about ten-thirty in the forenoon of the fifth of
last November that I saw a torpedo heading straight for
us at a distance of not over three hundred feet. It was
painted a bright red, and therefore, in the clear water,
even more conspicuous than the wake from its propellers
and air exhaust. It struck the ship fairly amidships on
the starboard side, and my first order was to lower away
the boats to port. I was not even thrown from my feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
by the shock, nor was there any sharp explosion audible.
Had I not seen the torpedo, I should for the moment have
been in some doubt as to what had actually happened.</p>

<p>My men were already standing by their gun, and the
instant the submarine put up its "eye" we took its range
and opened fire. At least one shell cracked right over the
periscope, causing it to disappear at once, and we did not
see it again until salt water had stopped the mouth of our
little rapid-firer.</p>

<p>The <i>Tara</i>, her engines still running, continued for some
distance on a perfectly even keel, the boats meanwhile
being safely launched with the surviving members of the
crew. Eleven had been killed by the explosion. Then, all
of a sudden, she began settling aft, and finally went down
like a sounding-lead, throwing her bows high in the air.
My gun crew and I were caught beneath the for'ard awning,
and owed our lives to the fact that we had no lifebelts
on, and were therefore able to dive and clamber
clear.</p>

<p>The submarine&mdash;the U35&mdash;rose to the surface and
came nosing into the wreckage before we had all been
picked up by our boats, but the fellows on the deck of it
contented themselves with covering us with their revolvers&mdash;a
precautionary measure, doubtless&mdash;and not
interfering with the work of rescue. I asked the commander
of the submarine if we might be allowed to proceed
to X&mdash;&mdash;, an Egyptian port at which a small British
force was stationed, and which we should have had no
trouble in making in a few hours. He replied, in excellent
English, that this would be impossible, as it was
necessary for him to deliver us to the Turks as prisoners.</p>

<p>The submarine then took our three boats in tow, and
headed for Port Sulieman, where we were landed at
about three in the afternoon. I made a part of the passage
on the deck of the U boat, and had some little chat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
with its commander. He admitted that we had nearly put
his "eye" out with one of our shells. He said that he had
been often to England before the war, and even confessed
to a visit to the Isle of Wight. He could not, of
course, be blamed for wanting to prevent our getting
back to a British port to report the probable existence
of a German submarine base on the Cyrenaican coast;
the callousness of his action only transpired later, when
it became evident that neither the Turks nor the Arabs
were able to house or feed us.</p>


<p>II&mdash;HELD PRISONERS BY THE ARABS</p>

<p>The Turkish officers at Port Sulieman were very
courteous, especially Nouri Pasha, who is a brother of
Enver Pasha, but palpably perturbed at the prospect of
caring for us. They were short of food themselves apparently,
and that region, like all the rest of Eastern
Tripolitana, is an almost absolute desert. Since their
German masters had decreed the thing, however, there
was nothing more to be said, and so, in the true Oriental
fashion of following the line of least resistance, they
passed us on to the Senussi. Since the Senussi had no
one else to pass us along to, they had to shoulder the burden
themselves and trudge on with it as best they might.</p>

<p>The ship's cook, who had died from his wounds in
one of the boats, we buried soon after landing, breaking
an oar to form a rude cross above his grave. That night,
still in our wet garments, we spent huddled together upon
some rocks by the shore. The next morning we were
given a small quantity of rice, which we had to cook as
best we could in some beef tins and eat with our fingers.
There was less than a handful of the tasteless, unsalted
mixture to each man. We were terribly cold, hungry,
and thirsty; indeed, for the next four months and a half,
there was hardly an hour in which we were not suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
a good deal from one, and usually all three, of these
causes.</p>

<p>After a couple of days we were moved back from the
coast to a primitive village where the people and animals
alike lived in dug-outs in the rocks. A "stable" which
had been occupied by goats, donkeys, and pigs was cleared
for us, and there, living in indescribable filth, we were
kept for four days. We had been forced to carry with
us on a stretcher, a quartermaster of the <i>Tara</i> who had
sustained a double fracture of one of his legs. At this
juncture, between filth and vermin, infection set in, and
the only chance of saving his life appeared to be amputation.
This&mdash;I will spare you the harrowing details&mdash;was
finally accomplished with no other instruments than a
pair of old scissors and a drop of whisky&mdash;our last&mdash;to
steady the poor fellow's nerves. Of course, he died.</p>

<p>The Arabs now told us that they were going to take
us to a beautiful oasis, where there were water and dates
in plenty, and flocks of sheep and goats, and warm houses
to shelter us in. Why they told us this I have never been
able to make out. Possibly to make us forget our ever-empty
stomachs; more likely because Arabs are incapable
of telling the truth even when they want to. At any rate,
we never reached the paradise that our captors persistently
dangled before us like the carrot on a donkey's
nose.</p>

<p>But march we did, marched endlessly, and most of the
time on less than a pint of vile water and a dozen ounces
of cooked rice a day. The country was one endless
stretch of small round pebbles that ground the soles from
our boots and the skin from our feet. We were always
hungry, always thirsty, always footsore. The sun at
noonday scorched us, the cold of the night chilled us.
One day, to make matters worse, a man who was off his
head from suffering ran away and evaded capture. Following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the Oriental practice, our guards must needs
punish the birds in the hand for the sins of the one in the
bush. For two days we were marched without a drop
of water or a morsel of food. The second day they
goaded us forward from daybreak to sunset. It seemed
as though we must have gone a hundred miles, and I
learned later that it was actually twenty. Even that was
an awful distance for starving men, who hadn't the
strength to walk in a straight line, to be driven.</p>

<p>For three long weeks they herded us on. At the end
of that time we arrived at what appeared to be our destination,
some half-ruined Roman wells called Bir-Hakkim,
the "Red Doctor" and the "White Doctor." It was
not an oasis in the true sense, but only three or four
caved-in cisterns, partially filled with reeking rain-water,
which served as a caravan halt. There were no houses,
no palms, no cultivation; only rocks and the crumbling
copings of the ancient wells broke the awful monotony
of the desert. Most of us arrived barefooted, all of us
half-naked; but it is due to our guards to say that they
were in scarcely better plight themselves, and that as
opportunity offered to get old boots and rags from passing
caravans they gave them to us.</p>

<p>One day I found a bit of broken glass, and with this
managed to scrape down some slivers of camel's bone
to the form of clumsy needles. Yarn we made by rolling
tufts of camels' hair, picked up along the way, between
our palms. The resulting strand was seldom less than an
eighth of an inch in diameter, and always lumpy and
prone to pull apart at the joints; yet, by dint of patience
and care, we were able to stitch fragments of rags together
to form hats and long Arab shirts. Those of us
who still had any parts of our socks and trousers left,
patched and darned them as best we could with our
bunchy yarn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Our daily ration, diminutive from the first, became
smaller and smaller as the days went by, and finally, to
stave off actual starvation, we began eating snails and
the roots of a small plant, with spreading leaves like the
arms of an octopus, which grew here and there among
the rocks. The roots had a pleasant, nutty flavour&mdash;I
could eat these few I have kept with the greatest zest at
this moment&mdash;but snails, roasted in their shells on a
camel-dung fire and eaten without salt, were, to say the
least, hardly up to that delicacy as served at the Maison
Riche. Most of us had a hard time in bringing ourselves
to eat them at all, and a few ever came really to like them.
One chap, however, a Welsh quartermaster, developed an
almost uncanny taste for the things, eating several hundred
every day, and actually waxing fat on them. Ever
since we have called him the "Snail King."</p>

<p>A few days after our arrival at Bir-Hakkim an Arab
woman came to our camp with some goats and sheep to
sell, but our guards either could not or would not buy
them for us. That night, however, a wolf killed one of
the sheep, and some of the men, out foraging for snails,
found and brought in the half-eaten carcass. Neither the
wolf himself, nor the waiting vultures, could have tackled
that flesh more voraciously than those half-famished sailors
did.</p>


<p>III&mdash;THE STRANGE TRICK OF FATE</p>

<p>It was about this time that we first learned the true
reason for the terrible scarcity of food, a scarcity that affected
the Arabs as well as ourselves. The Turks, it appeared,
had been successful in their intrigues with the
Senussi, and the sheikhs of this powerful Arab confederation
had declared war upon England and thrown their
forces against the Egyptian frontier. Sollum, but lightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
held at that time, had been taken, and the Arabs assured
us that their armies were marching on Alexandria and
Cairo. In retaliation for this treachery, the British Fleet
had extended its blockade to the Senussi coast, and the
hinterland, barren and almost entirely dependent for food
upon Egypt, was already in the grip of famine. The impetuous
Arabs were learning their lesson on the "influence
of sea-power" by being slowly starved into repentance,
and by a strange trick of fate we British sailors, who otherwise
would ourselves have been helping to drive the
lesson home, were being starved with them.</p>

<p>For some reason the guards made us draw our water
from the fouler of the two wells, the one from which
the animals were watered. We boiled the noisome green
liquid, and did our best to render it potable. It was all
to little purpose, however, for dysentery soon developed
and spread rapidly through the camp. As there were no
medicines of any kind whatever available, there was little
to do but let the disease run its course. This accentuated
the weakening influence of the starvation, and the wonder
is that we left no more than four graves behind us
in the accursed spot.</p>

<p>About December 20th a little flour, tea, and sugar were
given us, and we were told that this was the last of such
dainties that we might expect to receive. We decided
unanimously to keep on our diet of rice, snails, and roots
for four days longer, and save these luxuries for a
Christmas "spread." Here is our menu for that glad occasion,
as recorded in my diary:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Christmas Day</span>, 1915.&mdash;Breakfast, rice boiled with
a little salt. Dinner, two ounces of boiled goat flesh and
'pudding.' Tea, one small pancake, with weak tea."</p>

<p>By New Year's Day we were practically on an "all-snail"
diet, and the epidemic of dysentery appeared to
grow worse as a consequence. Two or three times in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the succeeding weeks camels came in with food, but never
in sufficient quantity to allow any increase in our tiny
ration. This continued to be rice, with an occasional goat
or sheep divided among five score of us. Without the
roots and snails it would not have been enough to keep
us alive.</p>

<p>Early in February I came to the conclusion that our
only chance of rescue lay in getting word of our whereabouts
through to some point in Egypt still occupied by
our forces. Figuring that one man would have a better
chance of escaping observation than two or three, I
finally decided to make the attempt alone. The nights
would be moonless, I calculated, for a week or more following
February 20th. For a fortnight preceding that
date I began saving a half of my daily ration of rice, and
as the news of my plan was gradually confided to other
men of the camp, these also began laying by a share of
their already pitifully small allowance. Thus about twenty
pounds of cooked rice were saved up, and this I tied
up in the legs of a pair of Turkish trousers given me by
one of the guards. To keep the soft mass from settling
down in one end, I tied the legs at frequent intervals
with bits of yarn, so that my novel knapsack finally had
much the appearance of a double string of German sausages.
My goat-skin water-bag held just two and a half
kettlefuls of water&mdash;forty-eight of the little jam-tins with
which I had to fill it.</p>

<p>The cordon round our camp was never tightly drawn,
and I had no difficulty in slipping through it on the night
of the 20th. I had kept mental note of the roundabout
route by which the Arabs had brought us to Bir-Hakkim,
and felt sure that I should be able to strike the coast at
some point near the Egyptian boundary. I held to my
pre-determined course by the stars, and stumbled on over
the stones till daybreak. I had met no one, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
were no signs of pursuit, but in the steady leaking of my
water through the semi-porous bag and the frightful way
in which the new Arab shoes I was wearing were rubbing
the skin from my toes, I forsaw thus early the almost certain
defeat of my hopes.</p>

<p>Lying down in as sheltered a place as I could find, I
rested till nightfall before setting off again on my way.
By morning my water, my toe-nails, and my strength
were gone, on top of which I stumbled straight into a
camp of nomad Arabs. Flight was out of the question,
so I made the best of a bad situation by trying to induce
them, in my fragmentary Arabic, to take me to the coast.
They understood me all right, and appeared not a little
tempted by the prospect of the double handful of gold
I promised them. They debated the question for a while,
but in the end their fear of the Turk was too strong, and
they decided I must be delivered to the nearest Ottoman
post.</p>

<p>My captors were not unkind to me; indeed, they treated
me rather as a prized animal pet, a sort of dancing bear,
than a dangerous captive. They exhibited me to everyone
they met along the way, even made a point of travelling
circuitously in order to show their strange find to some
encampments that would otherwise have missed the treat.
They never ceased to marvel at my ability to tell the direction
without a compass and the time without a watch&mdash;simple
tricks for a sailor&mdash;and seeing it kept them
good-natured, I made a point of going through my tricks
whenever they wanted them.</p>

<p>The Turks to whom I was finally brought were just
as courteous and sympathetic as those to whom we had
been delivered on landing, and they cannot be blamed for
deciding that I should be returned to the camp at Bir-Hakkim.
They were probably hard up for food themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>


<p>IV&mdash;HORRORS OF THE DESERT MARCH</p>

<p>I hardly care to go into details about that return journey.
Except that it was two or three days of horrible
nightmare, my memory of it is a good deal confused, and
I am rather thankful that such is the case. I am afraid
there were some things I shouldn't care to remember too
clearly. A fanatical old Senussi priest had come to fetch
me, and he rode on a camel and drove me ahead of him
with a long hippo-hide whip all the way. They gave me
no food and no water for two days, and my one clear recollection
of the whole time is of gulping down the nearly-hatched
eggs from a lark's nest I stumbled upon, and of
the horrible revulsion of my outraged stomach as the
nauseous mess entered it. But I'd really rather not speak
about that little interval at all.</p>

<p>Something of the nature of what Captain Gwatkin-Williams
had to go through on this journey may be inferred
from this entry in the diary of one of the <i>Tara</i>
men, under date of February 29th:&mdash;</p>

<p>"About 3 p.m. we suddenly heard rifle-shots to the
northward. A few minutes later there appeared over the
brow of a small hill some men and camels, and there,
walking apart from the rest, was our brave captain. We
were now witness of one of the most degrading and brutal
sights it has ever been my lot to see. He was lashed
with an elephant thong whip, and the guard punched him
violently in the face. Then the women came up and
pelted him with the largest stones they could find."</p>

<p>As a punishment for running away I was put in solitary
confinement in a goat-pen, where, for a day or two, the
old priest and some of the more temperamental of the
Arab ladies&mdash;the one with his hippo-hide whip and the
others with filth and stones&mdash;spent most of their idle
hours in trying to bring me round to a state of true repentance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
for my truancy. This treatment raised such a
protest from my comrades, however, that finally the
guards, on Lieutenant Tanner's undertaking full responsibility
for my docility in the future, restored me to full
camp privileges. That is to say, I was allowed my fistful
of daily rice again, and liberty to hunt my own snails
and dig my own roots.</p>

<p>Things grew rapidly worse during the next fortnight,
and by the middle of March it seemed that the end we
had feared and fought against for so long&mdash;slow starvation&mdash;could
not be much longer postponed. No more
food was coming in, the snails were breeding and absolutely
unfit to eat, and all the roots within a radius that
any of us still had the strength to walk to gather were
exhausted. Indeed, the strongest of us were by now so
weak that we could no longer keep our balance in stooping
to pull the roots, but had to kneel and worry them
out by digging and tugging.</p>

<p>The stock of rice was entirely exhausted early in
March, and from that time we lived on practically nothing
but a few ounces of goat-meat per man as a daily ration.
Famished as we were, even these tiny portions of
unsalted meat seemed to nauseate rather than nourish,
and in my own case the repulsion for meat engendered
during this period has persisted to this day. I am now
practically a vegetarian.</p>

<p>The plight of our guards was little better than our own,
except, of course, that when worst came to worst, they
could always abandon us and make their way across the
desert to some place where at least subsistence would be
obtainable. For ourselves, we were now quite incapable
of undertaking any kind of a march at all. Help would
have to come to us; it was quite out of the question for
us to search for it, even if our guards had been willing
to allow us to try.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>The last two or three days I do not like to think about.
We were too weak to venture far afield, and there was
little to do but sit about and brood over the fact that even
such almost negligible rations as we still had were nearly
at an end. We avoided each other as much as possible,
and when we did come together tried to speak of anything
but <i>the</i> thing that occupied all our minds. And
then, from the one quarter concerning which we had long
ago given up all hope, help came.</p>

<p>You see, we had written a good many letters from
time to time on the assurance of our guards that they
would be handed to the Turks for forwarding to England.
Most of these were probably thrown away or deliberately
destroyed, but, by a kind trick of fate, one
written by myself was taken by the Turks to Sollum
when the Senussi occupied that port. In this letter&mdash;no
matter how&mdash;I managed to indicate that we were held
captive and in danger of starvation at Bir-Hakkim.
When the British retook Sollum this letter, by a second
lucky coincidence, was left behind in the hastily-evacuated
quarters of a Turkish officer.</p>


<p>V&mdash;THE RESCUE AND THE RETURN TO
ENGLAND</p>

<p>Once definitely located, our rescue was only the matter
of assembling the requisite strength in armoured cars
and finding a competent guide. This done, our deliverance
was but a question of hours. But of how they
would have found things had anything delayed them for
even a few days I do not care to think.</p>

<p>It was about three in the afternoon of St. Patrick's
Day&mdash;we had celebrated it in the morning by making a
feeble attempt to kill off a few of the snakes that had
recently begun to infest the camp&mdash;that the first car was
sighted, and before we had finished pinching ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
to prove we were not dreaming the whole force of forty-one
were thundering down upon us. The ambulances
pulled up, and the attendants, as soon as they could free
themselves from the embraces of the men, began to
shower food about. Meanwhile, the armoured cars,
spreading out like a "fan," swept by in pursuit of our
fleeing guards.</p>

<p>Except for the Senussi priest, whom the sailors had
dubbed "The Old Black Devil," and who had departed
a couple of days previously, we had no special grounds
for complaint against the men upon whom the care of our
party had fallen. They had, for the most part, done the
best they could for us, and we had no reason to believe
that they had fared much better than their prisoners.
We would gladly have interceded for them if there had
been any chance. Taking it for granted, apparently, that
they would receive no quarter, they had taken to their
heels the moment the first cars came into sight, and a
panicky sort of resistance on a part of a few of them
when they were overtaken sealed the fate of the lot.
Save for a few women and children, all the Arabs about
the place succumbed to the fire of the machine-guns, and
a score or so of graves were added to the four of the
<i>Tara</i> men we had already buried at Bir-Hakkim.</p>

<p>We lost one more man in a hospital at Alexandria, but
the rest of us, thanks to good food and careful nursing,
were soon quite our old selves again. Practically every
man of us is back, or about to go back, on duty. Word
of my own new command comes only this morning.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tanner, R.N.R., captain of the <i>Tara</i> in her
merchant marine days, I found in his home at Holyhead.
Through the window of his cosy library, where he spun
his yarn, I could look out across the rocky coast of
Anglesea to where the slate-coloured patrol-boats kept
guard in St. George's Channel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lieutenant Tanner," I asked him, "what did the men
of the <i>Tara</i> talk about and think about, once the excitement
of the sinking, and the landing, and the march was
over and you were all settled down to the routine of
'prison life'?"</p>

<p>"First and always&mdash;food," he replied, promptly. "We
were famishing for the whole four months and more.
For a while we thought and talked a good deal of the
possibility of rescue; but as the weeks went by that hope
gradually died out, and our speculations&mdash;perhaps more in
thought than in word&mdash;were of how the end would come.
It was only during the last couple of months that the men
came to speak often on this subject, and they were, not
unnaturally, most prone to discuss it in the intervals of
deeper depression following the death of one of their
mates. We seemed to divide into two sharply differentiated
parties on this issue, the optimists holding that
our heritage of civilization and our discipline would enable
us to meet the worst bravely and resignedly, while
the pessimists maintained that we would gradually
slough off our civilized restraint&mdash;just as our clothes and
our conventions had gone already&mdash;and end by fighting
for life like a pack of wolves. The rate at which the
bickerings and petty quarrels over trivialities increased as
the days went by inclined more and more of the men to
the latter theory, but a few of us never wavered in our
belief, but it would be the man in us, and not the beast,
that would be supreme at the last.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;the officers&mdash;made a point of imposing no discipline
whatever upon the men, this extending even to non-interference
in their increasingly frequent disputes. We
held&mdash;and rightly, I am convinced&mdash;that anything calculated
to give an outlet to their feelings would make them
less likely to become a prey to gloomy thought. Sullen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
silent brooding was what we feared more than anything
else. Consequently, therefore, we rather welcomed the
occasional bouts of fisticuffs that marked the later stages
of our imprisonment. They unquestionably acted as
safety-valves to prevent more dangerous explosions.</p>

<p>"I also made what effort I could to keep the minds of
the men occupied. Every Sunday evening we met and
sang hymns, and on these occasions I usually read from
my Prayer Book and invited discussion on some text I
had given out the previous Sunday. Here"&mdash;turning to
his diary&mdash;"are some of the things we debated in our
weekly desert 'forums' by the old Roman wells:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'More things are wrought by prayer than this world
dreams of.'&mdash;From 'The Passing of Arthur.'</p>

<p>"'Love took up the glass of time.'&mdash;From 'Locksley
Hall.'</p>

<p>"'Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay
down his life for his friend.'</p>

<p>"'Does the end justify the means?'</p>

<p>"As you may well imagine, strange theses were developed,
and I am afraid that many a sore head resulted
from the preliminary discussions. It didn't take much to
start them going in that last fortnight after the snails
failed us; but the diversion was good for them, and, besides,
poor chaps, they were far too weak to be able to
hurt one another in the least. Their fights were like the
tussles of a couple of puppies. When you see some of
the boys on the steamer to-night, by the way, I can suggest
no more promising line of inquiry for you to pursue
than to ask them to tell you some of the things they used
to fight about in the desert."</p>

<p>Wireless Operator Birkby and Stewards Barton and
Fenton, who were among the <i>Tara</i> survivors, had, on
their return to England, been put to work on the <i>Tara's</i>
sister-ship, the <i>Greenore</i>, and it was behind the darkened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
windows of the smoking-room of this smart little packet,
as she bore into the snoring sou'wester which swept St.
George's Channel, that I contrived to gather the three of
them together to talk of their adventures.</p>

<p>"All I want to know," I said, "is a few of the things
you fellows used to punch each other's heads about in
the desert. I've got all the rest of the story."</p>

<p>They rose to that cast with a rush. All three commenced
talking at once, but the two stewards quickly fell
silent out of deference to the superior rank of the wireless
operator.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;THE WIRELESS OPERATOR'S TALE</p>

<p>"Easier to tell you, sir, what we <i>didn't</i> fight about,"
laughed Birkby. "At first it was mostly food. We didn't
have any 'pothecary's scales to divide it exactly with, and
when one lad got a few grains of rice more than another,
it wasn't in human nature not to make some bit of a mention
of it."</p>

<p>"That was wot you an' me 'ad our first tiff over,
matey," cut in Fenton. "It was the day after Captain
Tanner gave out the text 'love thy neighbour like thyself'
for us to ponder ower. You dipped into the pot
ahead of me, an' I said, 'How's a bloke goin' to love his
neighbour when that neighbour pinches half his rice?'
You filled your mouth with one hand an' clipped me one
in the jaw wi' t'other; an' as I went reelin' back I put
my foot into Bill's pile of toasted snails, squashing 'em
flat. So over he rolls an' starts to beat me afore I cud get
up. W'en at last I gets up the rice was all gone an' Bill
had copped all my snails to pay for the ones I squashed.
All I had to put down me gullet that night was some
of the squashed snails I salvaged from the sand, an' the
grit I ate with 'em started my dysentery going again fer a
week."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Birkby smiled, and nodded confirmatively. "Yes," he
resumed, "most of our fights were about food, but my
first one was about my trousers. You see, I was off watch
and turned in asleep when the torpedo struck the <i>Tara</i>,
and only just managed to get away in my pajamas. The
lower part of these I kicked out of in the water, and one
of the sailors of the submarine gave me a spare pair of
his German naval breeches. It was glad indeed I was to
have them. At first no one remarked them, but finally,
at the end of a hard day's march, one of the Welsh lads
passed some observation in his own language about me
accepting the bounty of the Hun. I didn't understand
exactly what he said, but to be on the safe side I clouted
him one then and there. But all the same," he concluded
after a pause, "I traded the Hun trousers to one of the
guards for a long Arab shirt, and got on without any
breeches for the rest of the time."</p>

<p>"An' not a bit worse off than most of the rest of us,"
added Fenton. "His 'burnoose' was a good foot longer
than mine."</p>

<p>"But it was X&mdash;-, the 'Snail King,'" continued Birkby,
"who was oftenest in trouble. We were all jealous
of his appetite for the wriggling things, jealous of the
quick way he had of spying and picking them up, and,
most of all, jealous of the way he was getting fat on
them while all the rest of us were wasting away to skeletons.
First and last, though, I think we were about quits
with him. You see, the way we cooked the snails was to
throw them on the coals till the blow-off of steam made
a sort of whistle to announce that they were done to a
proper turn. Well, little old Barton here, by dint of long
practising alone in the desert, developed a bit of a whistle
of his own which even the 'Snail King' himself couldn't
tell from the real thing. By tooting up at the proper
moments, old Barty had the 'King' setting his teeth in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
half-cooked snails for nearly a week before he twigged
the thing. Then, of course, he jumped on our little friend
here with both feet, and it took two of us half-fed ones
to drag him off."</p>

<p>"Aye, matey," Barton chipped in, "an' it took three
o' ye to hold him the week after when we planted the
loaded shells on him. I pinched a cartridge from one o'
a dozen snail-shells wi' powder. On top o' this I
rammed in the upper half&mdash;the 'orned half&mdash;of a snail,
an' scattered the shells where 'His Highness' cu'd find
'em, but for not 'avin' put 'em all on the coals at onct.
After the first ones began to blow up a post-mortem on
the remainin' ones revealed some of my infernal machines,
and then I laughed and gave the whole game
away."</p>

<p>And so they ran on. Fenton confessed to having had
to "clout" one of the quartermasters, because the latter
had been so "swanky" as to maintain that the torpedo that
sank the <i>Tara</i> was scarlet "when the bally thing was only
red"; and Birkby admitted to having closed his argument
for the negative on one of Lieutenant Tanner's Sunday
texts with, "And if you still think that 'Love is the greatest
thing in the world'&mdash;take <i>that</i>!" And as we slid up
the Liffey in the drizzle of the Irish dawn, Barton just
finished telling me how someone accused the first man to
sight the rescuing motors with eating the "Arabs' hemp
and 'seeing' things,'" adding that the two were circling
each other on tottering legs, looking for an opening, when
the bout was interrupted by the arrival of the Red Cross
ambulances. "Half a minute later," he concluded, "the
two of 'em was both guzzlin' over the same jam-tin."</p>

<p>There had, it appears, been some kind of a dispute over
everything, from the sand beneath their feet to the sky
above their heads, and, except for the higher officers,
just about every man of them had had some kind of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
set-to with every other one. And yet not even the fine
optimism of Captain Gwatkin-Williams and Lieutenant
Tanner convinced me so thoroughly as these off-hand recitals
of the ancient British spirit of give-and-take in
which they settled their petty troubles that, had the worst
come to the worst&mdash;had, for instance, the Duke of Westminister's
rescue party gone astray, as it nearly did&mdash;it
would have been the man, not the beast, in the <i>Tara</i> sailors
that would have triumphed in the end.</p>

<h2>THE WHITE SILENCE&mdash;WINTER IN
THE CARPATHIANS</h2>

<div class="center"><i>In the Snow-Clad Mountains with the Austrians
Told by Ludwig Bauer, of Vienna</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>This war has set new standards of endurance for the soldier.
They have been compelled to keep the field&mdash;to march, to fight
or to carry on siege warfare in the trenches&mdash;regardless of
weather conditions. Battles have frequently been fought while
a blizzard raged or while the thermometer stood below zero.
War in the solitary, snow-clad wastes of a mountain range is
war stripped of all its glamor. It is the repellant, savage
struggle of wild beasts or of primitive men stalking one another
and at the same time engaging in a life-and-death struggle with
the destructive forces of nature. Something of the extraordinary
physical and mental strain of service in the Carpathians in
the winter of 1915-'16 is conveyed in the following story by
Ludwig Bauer, the well known Viennese writer. It was published
originally in the <i>New Yorker Staats Zeitung</i>, with whose
permission it is here translated by William L. McPherson with
editorial note for the <i>New York Tribune</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE SNOWBOUND REGIMENT</p>

<p>The 3d company of the &mdash;st Regiment sits up there in
the snow and waits. It doesn't know what for, or for
how long. It may be that the next moment the field
marshal will come. It may be that they must squat there
another week.</p>

<p>About 300 meters below them runs the road. At least,
it runs there on the map. It cannot be recognized now;
it is just as white and smooth as the rest of the snow-covered
world around them.</p>

<p>That is the road over which they are to advance. But
just now no advance is possible. For the Russian artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
stands there on the mountain rising 700 feet high
above them and commands the way. So they must wait
until their artillery succeeds in locating the enemy's batteries.
That is a hard job, since the Russians have naturally
hidden themselves in the woods, and the tall, dark
trees seem impenetrable; they betray nothing.</p>

<p>Slowly and measuredly the flakes fall, as if they were
considering whether they should fall or not. The sky
is leaden and lowering. The men gaze at it stolidly. This
endless white has something deadening and stupefying
about it. They say little. They have already exhausted
their conversation, and nothing happens any longer to
start new talk.</p>

<p>With their snow mantles and snow caps they, too, look
completely whitened, as though they were a lean, haggard
collection of snow-men. They may not smoke, they
may not cook; the least flame or smoke would betray
them. They are not allowed to dig out trenches, for the
brown earth would be visible for miles, a dark spot on
the brilliant snow cover.</p>

<p>So there is apparently nothing to do but to stare into
the whiteness until the eyes smart, to keep silence and
to indulge in memories&mdash;to remember some past existence
which was not so white, so lifeless, so absolutely passive.
In the long run that is not very entertaining, but beggars
cannot be choosers.</p>

<p>The soldiers press the snow with their well-protected
fists until it is quite hard&mdash;almost solid. Then they lie
down on it as on a bed. When one gets used to it, it
furnishes a sort of warmth. But one must be careful
lest the hands, the nose and the ears freeze. The ears
are covered; one sticks his hands in his armpits, which
are the best stoves hereabouts. But the most difficult
thing is to protect the nose.</p>

<p>They have no fear&mdash;less fear certainly than anywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
else. Through the influence of this endless white shroud
of hills, mountains and valleys they have become calmer,
quieter, more thoughtful than ever. What it was a sacrifice
to give up in Galicia every one accepts here as a
matter of routine. For here they are clear out of the
accustomed world of villages or cities, even if those
settlements on the plain were settlements burned, ravaged
or deserted. They at least recalled the world of ordinary
experience and reminded the men of their former life,
with its desires or necessities. But here every civilized
tie is broken. Here they are alone&mdash;alone with the
enemy.</p>

<p>It is just as if foresters and poachers encountered each
other in the mountains.</p>

<p>They sleep, but that sleep is troubled by a sense of
the mystery which surrounds them, which conceals the
Russians from them and them from the Russians.</p>

<p>Carefully, measuredly, they eat at night their cold
conserves; it may be a long time before another fresh
supply comes to them over the meter-deep mountain
snows; and in the morning they wash themselves in the
snow, which here suffices for all uses&mdash;soap, drink, roadway,
bed and shroud. So another day comes, which may
bring an advance, an assault, perhaps a victory, if the
Russians show themselves. Instinctively they look out
into the white silence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The under officer was a Pole, but a Pole who spoke
German. He had a hatchet nose, very black, glowing
eyes and a pallid face. It seemed to me that he always
kept moving his hands uneasily. I noticed also the
golden medal for valor which he wore. I had milk chocolate
with me, and so he told me the story of how he got
the decoration. It was this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>


<p>II&mdash;TALE OF THE POLISH OFFICER</p>

<p>"We knew at last where the Russians stood. But they
were three companies strong, and we were only one, so
we couldn't well attack them. Besides, they stood near a
little wood and had machine guns. But we had to get
ahead. They were across our path, and there were other
reasons which my lieutenant explained to me, but which
I couldn't understand.</p>

<p>"So we decided to try to take them by surprise. But
that is very difficult, for on this accursed snow in the
Carpathians you can see everything. It would be almost
necessary to dip one's self into a barrel of flour. Fortunately,
a mist came in the mountains, and that night we
resolved to make the attempt.</p>

<p>"We knew exactly the direction; the first lieutenant
had made a drawing on which everything was clear and
plain. Two men were to be chosen who should steal
ahead and overpower the sentinels. Many volunteered.
Ignatz and I were selected.</p>

<p>"Everything depended on our not being discovered.
The company crawled behind us. It was compelled to
stop behind the last snow ridge; otherwise its presence
would have been detected. It was a bold enough stroke
to have gone that far; and except for the fog and the
snow even this could not have been accomplished. Two
hundred men always make some noise, however much
they try to avoid it. So they stayed behind the ridge,
about a hundred paces from the trees where the two
Russian sentinels were posted. Then it was for us to
do our work.</p>

<p>"The night was dark and the fog thick, but the snow
gave off a certain light. We did not see the two Russians,
but we thought we saw the shadows of the pine trees
under which they stood. We crawled along slowly over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the snow, each for himself. We had plenty of time.
The point was not to be quick, but to make no sound.</p>

<p>"We had taken off our shoes and wrapped our feet
in white woollen cloths. The ridge there was pretty
steep; but one couldn't tumble down it, for the snow
would have crackled. Ordinarily they would not have
heard it, nor would I have heard it. But on such a night
a sentinel could hear everything&mdash;it was so frightfully
still.</p>

<p>"Yet we got ahead. And then we could crawl further
on the level surface. I was very careful, and now and
then shovelled with my hands a little snow bank, so that
I could have some shelter if they discovered me.</p>

<p>"We couldn't see the sentinels yet; that is, I couldn't
see them. About Ignatz I know nothing, and nobody
will ever know whether or not he found them. There
may have been a deep hole somewhere in the snow cover,
or maybe he grew weak and fainted.</p>

<p>"About that I don't know. I crawled forward without
looking for him. Suddenly I heard the two Russians
talking, and quite near me. It couldn't be more than
twenty paces away.</p>

<p>"I held up. I had to wait till one of them went away
or till Ignatz came.</p>

<p>"They had been careless. But I was already so near,
and it is a wonder to me that they didn't notice me.</p>

<p>"I could have shot them; but that would have given the
alarm. I didn't want to attack them with the bayonet,
for they would have cried out and would have awakened
the vedettes, who were somewhere behind them, and then
the whole three companies would have been warned.</p>

<p>"I decided to strangle one of them. Ignatz would have
to make way with the other.</p>

<p>"The fog had become thinner; it broke into streaks
here and there. The sentinels were looking in my direction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
I believed that they must see me. If I only could
catch the expression on their faces!</p>

<p>"But I would not move; that was bound to betray me.
If they had shot at me then I should never have seen
them raising their rifles.</p>

<p>"Very slowly I moved my head. Then I noticed that
they turned toward each other and talked. They talked
continually, and that angered me. A sentinel ought not
to talk.</p>

<p>"Then a third man came along&mdash;an officer. He inspected
them, showed them something, looked sharply
about, particularly toward me. But I had already sunk
in the snow and did not move. Then he went his way.
I did not see him again.</p>

<p>"Scarcely had the officer gone when the two Russians
began to quarrel. At first I didn't understand why, but
it soon became clear to me, because one of them, the
smaller, went about thirty paces to the side, laid himself
under a tree and wrapped himself in his cloak, as if he
intended to sleep until the Judgment Day.</p>

<p>"It was plain that they were wrangling over which of
them should go to sleep.</p>

<p>"I was so glad. Now I didn't need to wait for Ignatz,
but could carry through the plan by myself."</p>


<p>III&mdash;THE PRIMITIVE SAVAGERY OF WAR</p>

<p>"Yet I had to get so near the Russian that I could
seize him by the throat at one jump. He must not be
able to cry out.</p>

<p>"And that was the hardest part of my task; compared
to it, all the rest was only child's play. For when one
man is so near another man, the other must either see or
hear him. I breathed as softly as a dying man, but kept
pushing forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"And when one is so impatient he imagines everything
possible. It seemed to me as if each movement I made
caused a frightful disturbance. But that was only the
hot beating of my blood.</p>

<p>"At last there was nothing which should have hidden
me from the vision of the Russian. I saw him distinctly
when he came in my direction. The snow beat in my
eyes, but I could not turn my gaze away from him.</p>

<p>"He was a tall Siberian and wore a snow cap. His
cheek bones stood out like those of a heathen, which he
probably was. He was thinking of nothing; sleeping as
he stood, like a rabbit with open eyes.</p>

<p>"That was my luck and his misfortune. That made
me bold. I ventured a quicker movement, sliding a whole
pace forward. He stood there, half turned toward the
wood. He must suddenly have sensed my presence, for
he became at once more wide awake and uneasy, walking
quickly to and fro with a restless movement, like a hen
when she sees a hawk above her.</p>

<p>"He lifted his gun as though to shoot; but not at me,
for I was almost at his feet. I think that he did not dare
to look ahead&mdash;at me&mdash;for the fright would have been
too great for him; he would have died of it.</p>

<p>"Then he turned to the other side to see whether an
enemy might be creeping up from that direction. That
was my moment&mdash;my time to do what I intended to do.</p>

<p>"Like a flash I started for his yellow, pock-marked
face. It seemed to me that I already had my hands about
his throat. The way I did it did not surprise me&mdash;I had
thought it out so carefully beforehand.</p>

<p>"It is frightfully hard to spring up after one has
crawled or lain so long motionless on the snow. I had
thought&mdash;I knew&mdash;that I must cause him no pain, that
it must happen in a second, in order that he might not
recover from his surprise and cry out. Therefore it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
was a frightful moment for me. Surely death itself is
not so frightful. Every muscle in my body was strained
and broken, it seemed to me. I cannot tell all that I
suffered, thought, felt, in that tiny space of time.</p>

<p>"He had turned around toward me, and in his face
was already the presentiment that he was going to die.
Never have I seen anything so grewsome as his horrified
look, even before I got my hands on his throat.</p>

<p>"He was, as it were, paralyzed. He did not think of
defending himself. He was too weak even to raise a
cry. I held him fast; that you can believe, for he sank
slowly in the snow without a sound.</p>

<p>"The other one under the trees slept soundly and his
throat rattled in his sleep. I went at him with the bayonet.</p>

<p>"Afterward I hurried back and gave the sign agreed
upon. Ten minutes later the three companies surrendered.
Thus I won my medal."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I shook the hand of this hero in parting I felt that
there remained in his own eyes something of the terror
of the Siberian whom he had throttled, and that that look
of terror would never leave his face.</p>

<div class="center"><i>The Plot to Dynamite the Welland Canal</i><br />
<br />
<i>Related by Horst Von Der Goltz, alias Bridgeman
Taylor, Welland Canal Dynamite Plotter</i>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Horst Von Der Goltz claims to be a secret agent of the German
Empire. He stated in court that his real name is Wachendorf.
In the trial of the so-called Welland Canal conspiracy in the
United States Court he was proved to have been the emissary
of Capt. von Papen, German military attaché, who seems to have
entrusted him with a mission to blow up the canal locks with
dynamite. From Buffalo Von der Goltz returned to New York,
and on Oct. 3 sailed for Genoa under a passport issued on
behalf of Bridgeman Henry Taylor. His next appearance,
according to the endorsements on his passports and other documents,
was in Berlin. He entered England from Holland in
November, 1914, and was imprisoned under suspicion as a German
spy. Among the papers taken from Capt. von Papen in
January, 1916, a check was found for $200 in favor of Bridgeman
Henry Taylor, and confronted with this, Von der Goltz
confessed complicity in the canal plot and was subsequently
requisitioned by the United States Government to give evidence
at the trial of Hans Tauscher, American representative of the
Krupps, and others indicted for plotting against the peace of the
United States. Further, confirmatory of Von der Goltz's relations
with the German Government, are documents set forth
in the British Government's official report of April, 1916&mdash;a
letter from Capt. von Papen requesting Consuls in Baltimore
and St. Paul to give Bridgeman Henry Taylor "all the assistance
he may ask for," and a letter signed Dr. Kraske, German Vice-Consul
in New York and addressed to Baron von der Goltz,
mentioning having called on him at the Holland House and
inviting him to call next day at the German Consulate to meet a
gentleman "who is interested in you." At the trial of Tauscher,
which involved international issues of the most serious nature,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>the defense bitterly attacked the character of Von der Goltz,
who appeared as chief witness against the accused. Witnesses
they brought from New Mexico and El Paso assailed his personal
character and integrity and the proceedings ended in
Tauscher's acquittal. In a series of articles published in the
<i>New York World</i>, Von der Goltz tells what purport to be his
adventures as a German secret agent. These confessions have
further been preserved in a book published by <i>Robert M.
McBride and Co.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;CONFESSION OF THE TEUTON SECRET
AGENT</p>

<p>The 3d of August, 1914, Gen. Raul Madero, my commanding
officer in the Constitutionalist army, granted
me six months' leave, with the privilege of extension, and
I left at once for El Paso, Tex., where I met Consul
Kueck at the Del Norte Hotel. I was informed that
Capt. von Papen would be in New York two weeks later.</p>

<p>On the 8th of August I left El Paso for Washington,
D. C., where I stopped only one day, having learned there
that von Papen would see me in New York in about a
fortnight. Aug. 10 I left Washington and went to Asbury
Park, N. J., spending about a week there on a visit
to relatives of Raul Madero's, and reaching New York
about the middle of August. I put up at the Holland
House.</p>

<p>Although I surmised, to say the least, that I was again
to be employed on service which must be secret, I had
taken no steps to conceal my identity. All the way up
from the border I had been a loose-tongued, hotly enthusiastic
German, full of bombastic enthusiasm. I kept
it up in New York. Interviews with me can be found in
the papers of that period in which I predicted the speedy
downfall of the Allies and Germany's sure triumph.</p>

<p>My reason for wearing this cloak of simple obviousness
should be apparent. It was my only sure disguise. Too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
many people knew me or knew of me as a former servant
of the German Government to let me hope I could escape
their scrutiny. The only way to hoodwink them was to
make myself seem such a fool that I could not possibly
be a spy.</p>

<p>So I made myself very apparent. I spent a great deal
of money in very foolish ways. I talked a great deal.
Result: All those interested said to themselves: "This
young idiot has picked up a bit of money in Mexico. It
is burning his pockets, and among other things has caused
him to imagine himself a person of importance. He a
German agent! Germany's far too clever to choose such
agents as he&mdash;who cannot even keep his mouth shut."</p>

<p>So I got the results I wanted. I have never flattered
myself on being exceptionally astute. My only claim to
cleverness must lie in the fact that I have generally realized
that the people I was dealing with were even greater
simpletons than I.</p>

<p>In the midst of all my strutting and gabbling, however,
I found early opportunity to report at the Imperial German
Consulate General, No. 11 Broadway. Two or three
days later, Aug. 21, 1914, the Vice-Consul, Dr. Kraske,
wrote me a letter, in his own hand, telling me that "a
gentleman who is interested in you"&mdash;Capt. von Papen,
to wit&mdash;would meet me next morning at the consulate.
It may be worth remarking that Dr. Kraske, of his own
volition, addressed the letter to "Baron von der Goltz."
I had used merely my Mexican military title in registering
at the Holland House.</p>

<p>I met Von Papen next day at the consulate. The conversation
at first touched on prevailing conditions in Mexico,
to which country, as well as to the United States, you
may remember, Capt. von Papen was jointly accredited as
Military Attaché. Attention was next devoted to a
scheme proposed to the German Embassy by a man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
had a plan for raiding Canadian towns on the Great
Lakes, using motor boats armed with machine guns. In
consequence of unfavorable information concerning the
writer this scheme was rejected, as were several other
tentative ones for various reasons. Among them was a
plan to invade Canada with armed forces composed of
German reservists in the United States, aided by German
warships then in the Pacific. Another, for a time considered
rather more feasible, was to seize the Island of
Jamaica, in the British West Indies, also with naval aid.
This plan, indeed, went so far that my Mexican rank of
captain received German ratification, in order to give me
military status should I be captured on British soil with
arms in my hands. But this, too, was given up.</p>

<p>The activity finally decided on was a plan to blow up
the locks of the canals connecting the Great Lakes, the
main railway junctions of Canada and the largest grain
elevators, with the double purpose of destroying one of
England's chief sources of food supply and of throwing
the Dominion into such a panic of suspicion that public
opinion would demand the retention at home of the Canadian
contingent of troops then mobilized for transportation
to England.</p>

<p>Our conferences led me to believe the plan was fairly
feasible and Capt. von Papen thereupon put entire responsibility
for the details of execution into my hands.</p>

<p>So the Welland Canal plot&mdash;the obvious part of it, and
the only part any outsider till now has heard a breath of&mdash;was
hatched and began to grow up under my protection.
Why it was permitted to be quite so obvious I
must reserve the explanation for a few paragraphs. The
one fact to note now is that it was almost transparent,
and that I took no precautions to make it otherwise. Instead,
I even talked and boasted of it and my important
part in its execution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>Two things were needed&mdash;men and explosives. The
first I got by going to Baltimore and asking for volunteers
from among the crews of the German merchant
ships laid up there. There were plenty of them. I selected
the ones I wanted, and their captain promised to
pay them off at the Baltimore Consulate and send them
to New York under charge of a ship's officer. In Baltimore
I was also supplied with a revolver, my own being
out of order, and with a passport for one Bridgeman
Henry Taylor&mdash;a passport issued by your American State
Department, supposedly to an American citizen. But he,
it merely happened, did not exist.</p>

<p>Back in New York, I reported to Capt. von Papen,
and, as I needed money for the sailors who were coming,
he gave me a check for two hundred dollars, drawn
by himself and payable to Bridgeman Taylor. I got it
cashed through the kindly offices of an acquaintance, Mr.
Stallford, a member of the German Club on Central Park
South. The sailors arrived in New York, were quartered
in various places and were immediately put under the
surveillance of detectives, just as I had expected and
indeed hoped. The explanation of my cherishing such
a seemingly absurd hope I must again momentarily defer.</p>


<p>II&mdash;A TALE OF DIABOLICAL CUNNING</p>

<p>Coming at the explosives was a more complicated matter.
How it was done is best explained by the documents
held by your secret service, which were part of the evidence
at the trial of Hans Tauscher in the Federal Court
here on a charge of plotting against the peace of the
United States. Tauscher testified that he had no knowledge
of the Welland Canal plot and that he sold the dynamite
believing it was to be used for mining in Mexico.
The jury believed him or gave him the benefit of a doubt,
for they acquitted him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>These documents, and others in the possession of The
World Magazine, show:</p>

<p>First, that Sept. 5, 1914, Mr. Tauscher, American representative
of Krupp's, No. 320 Broadway, New York,
asked the du Pont Powder Company to deliver to Bridgeman
Taylor 300 pounds of 60 per cent. dynamite and
send the bill to him.</p>

<p>Second, that on Sept. 11 the du Pont Company sent
to Tauscher a bill for 300 pounds of dynamite delivered
to Bridgeman Taylor, New York City, on Sept. 5; and
on Sept. 16 sent him a second bill for 45 feet of fuse
delivered to Bridgeman Taylor on Sept. 12, the total of
the two bills amounting to $31.13.</p>

<p>Third, that on Dec. 29, 1914, Tauscher sent a bill to
Capt. von Papen for a total of $503.24, the third item of
which, dated Sept. 11, amounted to $31.13.</p>

<p>Fourth, that on Jan. 5, 1915, von Papen requested some
one to draw a check for $503.24 to the order of Tauscher.</p>

<p>I went and got the dynamite myself from the du Pont
Company's dynamite barges lying off the Jersey shore
near the Statue of Liberty. I had hired a motor boat near
the foot of West One Hundred and Forty-Sixth Street
and I carried the stuff in suitcases. I took the whole 300
pounds in a taxicab to the German Club, and met von
Papen there. He told me to call later and he would
supply me with automatic pistols, batteries, detonators
and wire for exploding the dynamite. He kept his promise.</p>

<p>All these things I took, and part of them I stored in
the rooms I had taken in an obscure street and house in
Harlem. For by this time the boastful, talkative Major
von der Goltz was slipping down in the world. He could
no longer afford the amenities of the Holland House.
It must have been quite obvious to all interested that the
money he had brought from Mexico was almost spent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
There are certain advantages in looking impecunious, if
one knows how to use them. The furtive, secretive poor
man who does no work yet has what money he needs is
open to suspicion. But the broken spendthrift in his
seedy clothes who cannot pay his bills and yet does nothing
but talk of his own importance&mdash;he is manifestly a
fool.</p>

<p>So toward the middle of September the fool von der
Goltz and four companions&mdash;Fritzen, Tucker, Busse and
Covani&mdash;armed with automatic pistols and carrying suitcases
crammed with high explosives, were permitted to
leave New York, from the Grand Central Station, and to
go to Buffalo, where they took rooms at No. 198 Delaware
Avenue and were supplied with funds by wire from
New York on Sept. 16, being identified by a Buffalo lawyer,
John T. Ryan.</p>

<p>After that we went on to Niagara Falls, where, within
twelve miles, lay the locks of the Welland Canal, our first
and most important objective. While waiting for further
orders we fell victims to impatience.</p>

<p>For sitting and waiting was all we ever did. While my
superiors were hesitating to give the decisive word the
first Canadian contingent had left for England, and it
had been decided to postpone the attempt till another
crucial moment for Canada.</p>

<p>So the affair ended tamely, and the authorities of the
United States never guessed how close they had come
to being plunged into a complication which might have
made the Trent affair or the Alabama affair of Civil War
days seem small by comparison.</p>

<p>I have told you I was obviously in New York with a
purpose, and hoped to be unable to escape the attentions
of detectives and Federal Secret Service agents. They
could have stopped us at any moment, and they did not.
Why? Because they thought me an impractical fool, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
theatrical plotter, harmless, and wanted to let me thoroughly
compromise myself before they stopped me. If
the true circumstances had been like the seeming ones,
that would have been thoroughly sound policy, in accordance
with the best detective tradition. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The real circumstances were very different. My men
and I were a blind. We had our explosives and meant
to use them if we could. But the serious dynamiting was
not assigned to us at all, but to men already in Canada,
men thoroughly organized, men whose names in no way
suggested German sympathies and who were not at all
suspected, and never would be as long as we made-to-order
German plotters were at hand.</p>

<p>Imagine, then, what the effect would have been on public
opinion if those orders had not been countermanded.
The Welland Canal and others would have gone up, and
we would have seemed to be the perpetrators&mdash;we, whom
the United States Government might so easily have
stopped if it had cared to. I have been concerned in various
plots in my time, but never in one of a more devilish
ingenuity than this one that failed, or failed in part.</p>


<p>III&mdash;THE MACHINATIONS OF THE GERMAN
WAR OFFICE</p>

<p>I have tried, in writing here, not to speak with too
much awe of myself and my doings. But now I crave
your indulgence for a moment to call your attention to a
very serious aspect of the affair. This plot of mine that
seemed to fail, Werner Horn's attempt against the bridge
at Vanceboro, the talk of German wireless stations in the
woods of Maine, all the rumors of invasions of Canada
planned by German reservists in the United States, were
not so harmless and fruitless as they seemed. They
served to stir up talk. They were meant to stir up talk
and create the belief that some men of German descent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
living in America, were less American in their loyalty
than they were German.</p>

<p>Who made that talk? The German press agencies,
under Franz von Papen. And why? To set all German-Americans
apart from their neighbors by rendering their
loyalty suspicious; to band all German-Americans together
for self-protection, and so to dyke Germany from
the rising tide of world-wide disapproval. It was the
most coolly calculated betrayal I have ever come in contact
with.</p>

<p>But it was not my part to register disapproval, as the
film directors say. I came back to New York, reported
to Capt. von Papen and received instructions to go to
Germany, on the Bridgeman Taylor passport, and report
in Berlin to Department III. B of the General Staff.
Oct. 8, 1914, I sailed for Italy, carrying a letter of introduction
from Capt. von Papen recommending me to the
German Consul General at Genoa. He also gave me $200
to pay for my passage.</p>

<p>After the abandonment, at the last moment, of the plot
to blow up the locks of the Welland Canal with dynamite
paid for by Capt. Franz von Papen, at the time
German Military Attaché at Washington, I sailed from
New York for Genoa, Italy, whence the German Consul
General sent me on to the Prussian Consulate in Munich.
From there I went to Berlin, arriving Oct. 17, 1914. By
order, I reported to the General Staff, Department III.,
B, to the Foreign Office and to the Colonial Office, being
questioned at each place regarding my impressions of affairs
on the North American Continent.</p>

<p>Then I was ordered to report in person to the Emperor,
which I did at Coblentz, and was questioned in
great detail about the state of affairs in Mexico. After
being granted an opportunity to visit both the western
and eastern fronts, I was sent back to Berlin and given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the choice of going to Turkey or going back to Mexico.
I chose Mexico, and accordingly was sent to England, via
Holland, traveling on the American passport issued to
Bridgeman Henry Taylor.</p>

<p>I arrived in London Nov. 4, 1914. England was then
in the first and most feverish stages of the German-spy-phobia
which followed the outbreak of the war, and for
four days I thoroughly enjoyed the sensation of tickling
the Lion's whiskers, so to speak. Then the Lion suddenly
clapped a paw down and I was caught under it.</p>

<p>Nov. 8, 1914, I had gone down to the Horse Guards
to watch guard mounting. A crowd had assembled for
the spectacular ceremony. In the press a boy stepped
heavily on my foot. I had a corn there, it happened, and
promptly cursed him in round Mexican fashion, though
in English. Recollecting where I was, I was feeling in
my pocket for a penny to salve his feelings, when out of
the crowd I saw a face turned steadily toward me.</p>

<p>I knew the man at once. He was the friend of a very
celebrated Russian dancer, and I had once been instrumental
in exposing him, in Germany, as a Russian agent.
And he assuredly knew my face as well as I knew his.
I forgot the penny I was going to give the boy.</p>

<p>What should I do? The man had recognized me and
would undoubtedly report his discovery to the proper
quarter. But they would have no further proof of anything
against me. According to the papers in my pocket-book
I was a Mexican officer returning from leave of
absence. True, I was traveling on a false passport. But
why not? Constitutionalist Mexico had no officials to
issue passports just then, and German names on passports
were not convenient. Such a deception might have
been practised innocently enough, if I could only make
the English believe that I was not in German pay and
was not in England as a spy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>In a parliamentary White Paper (Miscellaneous No.
13, Series of 1916), you can find this statement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Horst von der Goltz arrived in England from Holland
on the 4th of November, 1914. He offered information
upon projected air raids, the source where the <i>Emden</i>
derived her information as to British shipping and how
the <i>Leipzig</i> was obtaining her coal supplies. He offered
to go back to Germany to obtain the information, and all
he asked for in the first instance was his traveling expenses."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is how it happened. In that brief moment of cogitation
in front of the Horse Guards, I saw that my one
safe method was audacity and directness, my only hope
to tell some sort of a story before my accuser could tell
his. So I went direct to Downing Street and the Foreign
Office, which was walking into the Lion's jaws with a
vengeance. I asked for Mr. Campbell of the Secret Intelligence
Department and told him I wished to enter
his service. What, he asked, did I claim to have information
about? Zeppelin raids, I told him, that being the
least harmful subject I could think of, in case my "traitorous"
offer should ever come to German ears. No topic
was more closely guarded, so I knew I could trust Berlin
to realize I was bluffing when I claimed any knowledge
of it. Also, it was a topic which vastly interested the
English.</p>

<p>The bluff went through to this extent: It left the British
authorities thoroughly at sea. My apparent good intent,
combined with my Mexican commission and American
passport, provided them with a puzzle which would take
a good long time solving. The only provable charge they
could bring against me was that of being an alien enemy
who had failed to register.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>


<p>IV&mdash;IN THE SHADOW OF DEATH IN A BRITISH
PRISON</p>

<p>So, on the 13th of November, I found myself arraigned
in police court on that charge. You may be sure I did
not complain. It would have been so very easy for me
to be standing before a court-martial, on a charge that
carried the penalty of death.</p>

<p>On the 26th of November I was sentenced to six
months at hard labor at Pentonville Prison, with a recommendation
for deportation at its expiration. I served
five months at Pentonville, and then my good conduct
let me out. Home Secretary MacKenna signed the order
for my deportation. But I was not deported.</p>

<p>Instead, I was thrust into Brixton Prison. In Brixton,
though I was not sentenced on any charge, I was kept in
solitary confinement until January, 1916, when I was
transferred to Reading Jail. At Reading&mdash;locale of Oscar
Wilde's ballade&mdash;conditions were less disagreeable
than they had been at Brixton. I was allowed to have
newspapers and magazines and to talk and exercise with
my fellow prisoners.</p>

<p>All this time, you may be sure, attempts were made to
secure further information from me, and especially to
solve the enigma of my personal identity. But I stuck
steadfastly to my story. By that time it had crystallized
to this: I was Horst von der Goltz, born in Gautemala of
German parents, but not a German citizen. I was an
officer on leave from the Mexican army and had used the
Bridgeman Taylor passport from necessity. From necessity,
too, I had concocted the fable of wishing to sell information
to the British Government, in the natural hope
of avoiding the predicament in which I found myself.</p>

<p>Try as they would, the authorities could find no evidence
to knock holes in that story. And it was then I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
conceived a deep personal liking for British sportsmanship.
They were deeply suspicious, but they compelled
themselves to play fair and give me every chance.</p>

<p>You recall that in December, 1915, on President Wilson's
request, the German Government recalled Capts.
Boy-Ed and von Papen, its Naval and Military Attachés.
They traveled home on personal safe-conducts from the
British and French Governments. You may remember
also that Capt. von Papen took along with him a number
of personal papers, and that when the ship which bore
him touched at Falmouth, England, these documents were
seized. Complaining, he was reminded that his safe-conduct
covered only his body, and that he wore his
clothing merely by the British Navy's courtesy. That
seizure of his papers happened on Jan. 2, 1916.</p>

<p>Being now permitted to read the daily papers, I heard
of it, even in Reading, and at first was greatly alarmed.
But nothing happened. The documents were published
and made a great deal of sensation in England. But my
name did not appear. It had been deleted by the censor,
so it later appeared.</p>

<p>Ten days of false hope that deletion gave me, and then,
on the night of Jan. 30, 1916, the Governor of Reading
told me I was to go up to London next day. Where to?
Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Any moment more dramatic than that of my entrance,
next morning, into the Commissioner's room at Scotland
Yard I do not wish to live through. Some one else may
have that excitement.</p>


<p>V&mdash;THE TALE OF THE LITTLE PINK CHECK</p>

<p>There were several men in the room&mdash;Capt. William
Hall of the Admiralty's Intelligence Department, Mr.
Nathan, Capt. Carter of the War Office and Mr. Basil
Thompson, Assistant Commissioner of Police. They all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
looked very grave. There was one big table in the center
of the room, and on it was one little oblong piece of
paper&mdash;pink paper.</p>

<p>One of them picked it up and held it where I could
read it. A reproduction of it was printed in the preceding
installment of this series.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="right">"Washington, D. C., Sept. 1, 1914.</div>
<p>"<span class="smcap">The Riggs National Bank</span>:<br />
"Pay to the order of Mr. Bridgeman Taylor two hundred
dollars.
</p>
<div class="right"><span class="smcap">F. von Papen.</span>"</div>
</blockquote>

<p>When I had read that he turned it over for me to see
the indorsement: "Mr. Bridgeman Taylor."</p>

<p>"Sign your name, please&mdash;'B. H. Taylor.' Do you
know that check?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I admitted.</p>

<p>"Why was it issued?"</p>

<p>"Von Papen gave me the money to go to Europe and
join the army."</p>

<p>"Ah! Von Papen gave it you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was doing quick thinking. That little pink check
might easily be my death warrant. In that trunkful of
documents, it seemed more than likely, were reports and
instructions with my name sprinkled through them, since
that check had been there. My last chance was gone,
after all those months of bluffing.</p>

<p>I have sense enough to know a game is up. If people
have positive proof that you have done a thing it's no
use saying you have not. I saw one chance&mdash;and one
chance only&mdash;of extricating myself. I must make a confession.
But it must be a peculiar sort of confession.
To carry conviction it must admit everything material
contained in Capt. von Papen's seized papers where my
name was implicated. And, not to be disloyal, it must
admit nothing more&mdash;nothing, in other words, that England
was not already cognizant of from other sources.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
How to do that&mdash;to bluff them once more, to a finish.</p>

<p>I swung round on them.</p>

<p>"Are you the executioners of the German Government?"
I asked abruptly. "Are you so fond of von
Papen that you want to do him a favor? You will be
doing just that if you try and shoot me."</p>

<p>"We are going to prosecute you on this evidence," was
the only answer.</p>

<p>"You English pride yourselves on not being taken in,"
I said. "Von Papen is a very clever man&mdash;are you going
to let him take you in? Do you think he was fool enough
not to realize that those papers would be seized? Do you
think"&mdash;this part of it was a random shot, and lucky&mdash;"do
you think it is an accident that the only papers among
them referring to a live, free, unsentenced man in England
refer to me? Just look! Von Papen has been recalled.
The United States can investigate his doings now
without embarrassment. And he, knowing me to be the
connecting link of the chain of his activities, and knowing
me to be a prisoner liable to extradition, would ask nothing
better than to get permanently rid of me. And in
the papers he carried he very obligingly furnished you
all the proofs you need before you shoot me. You can
choose for yourselves. Do him this favor if you want
to. But I think I'm worth more to you alive than dead.
Especially now that I see how very willing my own Government
is to have me dead."</p>

<p>They got the point and the veiled promise and were
willing to give me immunity in return for a confession
and revelation of the workings of German secret agencies.
So much ground was gained. The hardest stretch
still remained to gain&mdash;to get some inkling of what I
must tell and what I must keep silent about. That knowledge
was very hard to come at. But from one of them,
who had known me all through my fifteen months' fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
for life and liberty, and had sympathized, I managed to
get, without arousing his suspicions, a sketchy notion of
what ground the seized documents covered.</p>

<p>It sufficed to put the bluff through. That night they
lodged me in Brixton Prison, with a supply of stationery,
and I wrote down my "voluntary statement," taking care
to incorporate in its closing paragraphs the promise already
made me verbally, "I have made these statements
on the distinct understanding that the statements I have
made, or should make in the future, will not be used
against me; that I am not to be prosecuted for participation
in any enterprise directed against the United Kingdom
or her Allies I engaged in at the direction of Capt.
von Papen or other representatives of the German Government,
and that the promise made to me by Capt. William
Hall, Chief of the Intelligence Department of the
Admiralty, in the presence of Mr. Basil Thompson, former
Governor of Tonga and Assistant Commissioner of
Police, and in the presence of Supt. Quinn, political
branch of Scotland Yard, that I am not to be extradited
or sent to any country where I am liable to punishment
for political offenses, is made on behalf of His Majesty's
Government."</p>

<p>On Feb. 2 I was asked whether I was willing to swear
to the truth of my statements. They were true, as far
as they went, and I swore so.</p>

<p>So by sheer bluffing I got out from between the Lion's
paws. They sent me to Lewes Prison then. With its
baths and lawns for tennis, it hardly seemed a prison, and
I was content there until last spring, the United States
Department of Justice needed me as a witness in its
Grand Jury proceedings.</p>

<p>I came over, gave my testimony&mdash;and now here I am.
One volume of my life's history apparently is written to
a <i>Finis</i>. What will the next one be, I wonder?</p>

<p>I&mdash;TALE OF MYSTERY OF THE ABANDONED
CHATEAU</p>

<p>During the early months of the war, Corporal R. J.
Mullins, of the 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade, was among
those who helped to stem the flood of Germans advancing
on Paris. He is a slight, boyish figure, with merry,
laughing eyes, and in spite of two serious wounds from
shell-fire manages to-day to cram as much vitality into
his life as any six ordinary men. I met him in hospital,
where he related to me the following curious experiences.</p>

<p>One evening his regiment was ordered to attack a
château which the German General Staff was known to
have occupied the previous night. No enemy soldier,
however, was found there when the British arrived&mdash;nothing
except signs of a hasty evacuation. On the table
were the remains of an interrupted meal, some of the
pictures had been removed, and everything of value in
the mansion had been taken away.</p>

<p>Mullins and his companions had been marching for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
days in rough campaigning conditions, and almost
the first thing the corporal did on entering the fine <i>salle
à manger</i> was to fling himself into an arm-chair beside the
gas fire of imitation logs.</p>

<p>"Everything's been cleared out," exclaimed one of his
comrades. "The Germans have left nothing."</p>

<p>"And what if they had?" asked the corporal.</p>

<p>"We've strict orders not to loot, and I'm going to see
them carried out."</p>

<p>"But there's orders <i>and</i> orders," responded the other.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, it's all the same," returned Mullins. "There's
going to be no looting if I can help it."</p>

<p>Thereupon the rifleman sat down beside his companion,
and for several minutes they smoked together. Then, all
of a sudden, they heard the whistle sounding the fall-in
outside, and both prepared to go. Mullins snatched his
cap hastily from a Louis XV. sideboard that covered half
the length of the room, and to his amazement several
secret drawers opened. In some curious manner his cap
had touched a knob, thereby releasing a concealed spring.
The drawers were full of wondrous treasures of early
French art&mdash;vases and cups of silver-gilt or gold, studded
with precious stones and other valuables. Before him lay
wealth and treasure enough, probably for a King's ransom.</p>

<p>Very thoughtfully the corporal closed the drawers
again, leaving everything exactly in order as he had found
it. After all, orders <i>were</i> orders&mdash;but what a chance for
the German Crown Prince!</p>

<p>By this time his comrades had all fallen in, and already
he could hear the steady tramp, tramp of their footsteps
marching away in the distance.</p>

<p>As he scrambled hastily out of the door of the château,
Mullins realized that he was alone, and that in his hurry
he had somehow taken the wrong road. There was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
one to be seen anywhere, and he could no longer hear the
regiment. A few minutes later he was stumbling along
through the grounds of the house, groping his way in the
darkness, trying to find the highway. Presently he discerned
that he was in a field enclosed by a high wooden
fence, and went hurrying across it. Right out in the open
he collided with some heavy object, only to recoil in horror
as the thing moved and snorted. Its back was wet&mdash;wet
with what the corporal later discovered to be blood.
The animal, wounded probably by malevolent design,
rose to its feet, its long horns and huge bulk shaping
through the darkness as the form of a bull. Conceiving
Mullins to be one of its tormentors, the bull first lashed
its tail angrily against its sides and then galloped full
pelt after him. By this time Mullins had reached the
side of the corral, and crouched there, hoping that the
darkness would cover him. But he was mistaken. The
bull charged down upon him with lowered head, and drove
its horns deep into the fencing on each side of the horrified
man's head. There it remained fixed just long
enough to give Corporal Mullins time to crawl out and
scramble over the corral, glad to find himself still alive
and uninjured. An hour afterwards he rejoined his regiment.</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF WOMAN WHO WALKED IN THE
NIGHT</p>

<p>Yet another queer experience befell the corporal a
short time later. It occurred when he was on "listening-post"
between the trenches&mdash;one of the most arduous and
dangerous jobs the war has to offer. Corporal Mullins,
with a couple of comrades, was on duty in a listening-post
hard by Armentières. On the previous day the Germans
had attacked and been beaten off, and our troops were expecting
a further assault that evening. Already the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
guns were battering away at the entrenchments. The
three men lay in front of a shallow stream, on the
other side of which rose grimly the high banks of the
German earthworks. Suddenly the noise of the cannonade
ceased. Very intently the watchers listened, for the
silence was ominous and foreshadowed an assault. After
a few moments' suspense, Mullin's arm was touched by
one of his companions. From across the stream the wind
wafted to them the unmistakable sound of someone walking
through the water. The three gripped their rifles in
alarm. The Germans were coming! But nothing happened.
They heard men breathing hard and straining at
their work, and gradually the explanation dawned upon
them. The disturbing noise was nothing worse than the
enemy bailing water from their trenches into the stream!
The three laughed silently, greatly relieved at the discovery.</p>

<p>The bailing continued for some hours, when the sound
was supplemented by another. This time there was no
room for doubt; stealthy footsteps were approaching
them, plash, plash through the water. Probably it was a
spy. Right into their waiting arms the crouching figure
walked. A hand promptly covered its mouth, and it was
pulled down. Then the trio gasped, for they discovered
from the soft cheeks and long, dishevelled hair that their
captive was a&mdash;<i>woman</i>!</p>

<p>One of the men thrust her into a hole burrowed by an
enemy howitzer, and they flashed an electric torch into
her face. Despair, shame, horror&mdash;all the elements of a
more terrible tragedy than ever Euripides made immortal
were written in the poor girl's features. Disgraced she
was for ever in the eyes of her kith and kin, one of the
hapless victims of the Huns. She had escaped from her
captors, it appeared, and had come to the British lines
to seek refuge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>The three men laughed again, as silently as before;
but this time their mirth was full of terrible meaning,
pregnant with thoughts of vengeance.</p>


<p>III&mdash;THE VENDETTA&mdash;AN EYE-FOR-AN-EYE</p>

<p>From Flanders we will turn to Gallipoli. A man had
just been shot in the first line trench at Anzac by a sniper.
Private Roy Scotton, the 5th Field Ambulance, A.I.F.,
had been hurried along with a stretcher to bear him away
for burial.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked one of the bearers as they picked
up the soldier. The sergeant of the section, his head bent
to avoid hostile bullets, came hastening along the trench.</p>

<p>"Who's down this time?" he asked in turn. But there
came no response from the bystanders. Some busied
themselves with the breeches of their rifles; some, who had
commenced a smoke, put aside their tobacco. The dead
soldier's face had been covered with a blanket.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked the sergeant once more, sick with
apprehension. He was a brave man, a man inured to
campaigning of all kinds, cunning in battle against the
Turk, crafty in his fight against Nature in the Australian
bush, wily in his dealings with political antagonists at his
home in New South Wales. For this was "Paddy" Larkin,
a popular Australian M.P. Pulling aside the blanket
covering the dead man's face, he gave a cry of horror.
It was his own brother!</p>

<p>He bowed his head reverently for a moment over the
cold, set features; then, snatching a rifle and bayonet from
the man nearest him, he scrambled quickly across the
trench. Before any man present suspected his intention,
"Paddy" Larkin was leaping towards the enemy to avenge
his brother's death. A storm of bullets opened on him.
They lashed the sand around him: they tore into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
clothes, into his body. Still he went on. Over the wire
entanglements, over the parapet he leapt, his bayonet
thrusting savagely at the Turks. Very short and fierce
was the fight, but "Paddy" Larkin died happy. His
brother's death was avenged.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;"HE SHOT MY CHUM!"</p>

<p>Of a somewhat similar nature is the following story,
also related to me by Private Scotton. A Turkish prisoner
had been caught. He was an officer, a brilliantly-educated
man, accomplished in several modern tongues.
After examining him the company captain resolved to
dispatch the prisoner to Brigade Headquarters, where he
would have proved very useful. A corporal was told off
to escort the prisoner, and on arrival at "H.Q." handed to
a staff captain the official document containing full particulars
of his prisoner. Having read through the report,
the officer ordered the prisoner to be brought to him.</p>

<p>"It's not possible," responded the corporal.</p>

<p>"How not possible?" demanded the other angrily. "Has
he escaped?" News of the Turk had already been telephoned
through to Headquarters, and the staff there
had resolved to take full advantage of the man's knowledge.</p>

<p>"No; he's not escaped exactly," commenced the corporal,
slowly. "He spoke English, and on the way here we
talked of different things. He spoke of his home in Syria,
and then we got talking about prisoners&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what's all this to do with me?" asked the officer,
sharply. "Why have you arrived here without the prisoner?"</p>

<p>"We spoke of prisoners," repeated the man, stolidly,
"and I asked him what had become of my 'cobber,'<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> who
was captured in a sap-head a week ago. The officer remembered
him. 'He was spying on us,' said he. 'My
men brought him in to me.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>
<p>"'And what became of him?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'Oh, I had him shot,' he told me.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," concluded the corporal, "he shot my
chum. That's all, sir."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," exclaimed the staff captain.</p>

<p>"He shot my chum," repeated the corporal, "so there
was only one thing to do."</p>

<p>"So you shot <i>him</i>?" asked the officer, drumming his
fingers on the table.</p>

<p>The soldier nodded. Then he saluted smartly and
marched out.</p>


<p>V&mdash;THE STERN CALL OF DUTY</p>

<p>No embroidery is required to elaborate the following
episode: it is a bit of grim reality. The Prussian Guard
had just delivered an attack around Ypres. For days
they had been paving the road to Calais with their own
corpses. At that time, you will remember, we had no
high explosive to spare to beat off these assaults; only
shrapnel, and none too much of that. In an advanced
trench before the British lines were the Northumberland
Fusiliers, firing with another regiment. Commanding
a fraction of the latter regiment was a young lieutenant,
whose greatest chum happened to be directing the fire of
our batteries. In those days each shot had to tell, and it
was resolved that when the enemy rallied again for another
attack, fire was to be held until the Germans were
immediately in front of our trenches. Among the "Fighting
Fifth," as the Northumberland Fusiliers are affectionately
called, was Corporal R. J. Glasgow, of the 2nd
Battalion. Many of his comrades had fallen that morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
and as he crouched in the ill-sheltered trench, an old
"pal," who as a boy had worked with him on the Elswick
Shipbuilding Yard on the Tyne, talked with him of old
times. He offered the corporal a cigarette, and, as Glasgow
felt through his pockets for a match, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I want to enjoy this smoke. It'll be our last together."</p>

<p>"You think the Germans are getting through this time?"
asked the other.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think they'll get through. But, anyhow,
I've a kind of presentiment that this is our last smoke
together."</p>

<p>During the day they lay together, smoking and yarning.
Hard by the artillery major was preparing busily for the
attack everyone knew was to be delivered that evening.
At length the day waned, the red disc of the sun silhouetted
in sharp relief against the battered tower of Ypres
Cathedral. Night fell, and at last the German guns
belched a furious cannonade against the poor earthworks
held by our fellows. When they had done their work the
Prussian Guard poured out of their holes and mounds and
stormed towards the British.</p>

<p>Until they were almost upon our lines the British guns
were silent. Then, when the enemy were practically at
hand-grips with those holding the advanced trenches, a
terrible fusillade opened upon the Prussians. By some
unfortunate mistake, however, the range had not been
accurately calculated; our shrapnel was bursting too far
behind the attacking enemy. There was but little time to
think; immediate action was imperative. Desperate cases
are cured only by desperate remedies. Either that little
handful of men in the front trench must be sacrificed, or
the enemy would burst through the British lines.</p>

<p>The major directing the artillery fire was in a terrible
quandary, for among the men who would be sacrificed
was his dear friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet he knew his duty as a soldier, and he did not hesitate.
He directed the range of the batteries to be shortened
until the shells were bursting over the trench, and
his chum fell, pierced with bullets. That same evening
the major himself was found&mdash;dead by his own hand, a
revolver by his side. Corporal Glasgow was carried to a
dressing-station with sixteen bullets from British shrapnel
in his leg, and his friend of the cigarette episode had been
shot through the brain. That terrible night furnished a
long list of casualties for the British, but Ypres had been
saved, and the road to Calais was still guarded by the
thin khaki line.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;THE BRITISH SERGEANT'S UNCONSCIOUS
FIGHT FOR LOVE</p>

<p>Lance-Corporal W. Bird, of the 1st Battalion Norfolk
Regiment, who was also wounded at Ypres, recounted
the following incident to me. Its central figure is a sergeant
of his own regiment, and it commences in those first
vivid days of the war, when the Germans were swarming
over the border. A company of ragged Chasseurs
d'Afrique had burst through a village. Some limped and
were blood-stained; all breathed heavily in great gasps,
and they were plastered with mud and haggard for want
of food and sleep.</p>

<p>"It's all up, Mother Vinot," shouted the corporal, a
burly Alsatian, to a shivering old creature outside the
village <i>débit</i>. "The Boches are upon us."</p>

<p>Hobbling into the wine-shop, the old woman bade her
grandson hasten the loading of the bullock wagon. He
was a tall, weedy lad fresh from school. "They won't
hurt us, <i>petite gran'mère</i>," said he. He lifted his belt,
displaying the thick butt of a revolver he had taken from
a dead hussar lying under his horse on the roadside. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
will protect both you and the English milady, <i>nom de pipe</i>.
These are great times for men."</p>

<p>The English milady huddled closer to the fire. She had
only left Brussels on the previous day; the wagon on
which she had travelled had broken down in the mud.
While his grandmother hid their last barrel of cognac
under the flooring, Jean busied himself with the bullock
wagon. It was soon loaded, for their household effects
were not extensive. Clambering into the vehicle, they sat
their bullocks ambling through the deserted street. Here
and there lay groups of dead soldiers; over the bodies
the bullocks picked their way carefully. The roar of the
cannon and the ear-splitting crack of the rifles had now
ceased. The Germans were advancing cautiously upon
the village.</p>

<p>The boy urged the unwilling beasts with his goad. Inside
the wagon, the English milady shuddered in horror
at the spectacle of the stark bodies around them, and at
last she broke into sobs. The crone, who sat at the
shafts of the vehicle telling her beads, looked curiously
at her. The lady was speaking.</p>

<p>"Last night I dreamed he was dead," she cried, in
French. "I fear to look at these poor creatures; I fear
I may find him among them."</p>

<p>At that moment there was a rustle in the hedge bordering
the road. The boy caught glimpse of rifles levelled at
his companions.</p>

<p>"They're spies!" shouted a voice in English. "Shoot
the wretches down. It's another of the German dodges."</p>

<p>"Let the poor devils go," cried another voice. "I've
seen the old woman in the village before, and the boy ties
a good trout fly. I know them both. Don't shoot."</p>

<p>But one of the soldiers had levelled his rifle and fired.
"There's one of their dirty officers huddling in the wagon
behind the old woman," cried he. Already, however, Jean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
had the wagon turned, and the bullet missed its mark.
Thrusting his goad deeply into the bullocks, Jean speedily
made the maddened animals trot forward. There was no
more firing. Very soon the little party had turned by the
<i>curé's</i> house at the bend of the road, and were in the village
again.</p>

<p>"The Germans have us both ways," said Jean, entering
the tiny courtyard of the <i>curé</i>. "We'd best leave our
load here and hide. There is a famous place in Père
Vincent's hayloft." Bidding them climb the ladder to the
loft, Jean stood on guard behind the open gates.</p>

<p>There was a clatter of hoofs along the road, the glint
of lances, and a number of Uhlans dashed at a mad gallop
through the village. At the bend of the road they
halted. Something had aroused their suspicion. One
of them dismounted and began to examine his horse's
shoes. His three companions, meanwhile, trotted back
to the wine-shop and proceeded to batter the door down.
Jean glanced first at the men entering his home; then at
the dismounted soldier. His mind was soon made up.
There were only four of them, and of those he could give
good account. Taking careful aim with his weapon, he
pressed the trigger. Like a stone the Uhlan dropped beside
his horse. Hearing the firing, his comrades rushed
from the wine-shop, mounted their horses, and clattered
down the street towards the boy. Jean stepped out from
his hiding-place and stood full in front of them. His first
shot struck the leading man's horse. The animal stumbled
and flung its rider white and still on the road. Following
hard at his heels, the second horseman came down with
a crash, the legs of his steed tangled in the reins of the
first. Jean pointed his weapon for the third time. But
there was no report&mdash;he had fired his last cartridge! The
remaining Uhlan, with a fierce curse, lowered his lance
and charged towards the lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>Jean never knew exactly what happened after that. He
remembered hearing men hard by cheering in a strange
tongue; he remembered, too, the firing of rifles behind
him; but after that he could recollect no more. Milady,
who had been a governess in Brussels, crouched in the
hay with the old woman and shuddered. They heard the
galloping of the horses, the curses of the soldiers, and
the firing, but they understood nothing of its significance.
Then came the thunder of a shell bursting beneath the
loft. The place took fire and the loose straw sent up
clouds of smoke which helped make the terrified women
and their position more terrible. They heard one sharp
crackle of musketry; then dead silence. This was broken
at length by footsteps advancing over the courtyard.
They halted cautiously at the threshold of the barn, and
then made a bold dash. Seeing nobody, the men halted
again.</p>

<p>"I heard voices here," the first man shouted to a comrade.
"Somebody is hiding hereabouts&mdash;some of the
Huns."</p>

<p>Seizing the rungs of the ladder in one hand, he clambered
like a cat towards the loft.</p>

<p>"Let the pigs burn," growled his comrade after him.</p>

<p>The women were hidden in the straw, but the soldier
saw it move, and poised his bayonet over milady's breast.</p>

<p>"Come out of that," he shouted. In astonishment at
hearing the sound of her own tongue, the Englishwoman
moved her hands from her eyes.</p>

<p>"Save me!" she implored, and held her hands appealingly
towards the soldier. And then Mme. Vinot was the
witness of a strange scene. For the soldier, with a
startled exclamation, flung down his rifle, seized the
woman in his arms, kissed her, and spoke her name in
endearing terms. It was her sweetheart, and twice that
day, all unknowingly, he had saved her life! Lance-Corporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Bird was present at the sergeant's wedding some
months afterwards, and vouches for the happy ending
of the story.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;TALE OF THE MOHAMMODAN WOMAN
SNIPER</p>

<p>When the war broke out, plain John Gallinshaw, a
graduate of Harvard University, was earning the hardest
of all livings as a journalist by the sweat of his pen. His
home being in Newfoundland, he hurried back there, enlisted,
came to England with the draft in the 1st Battalion
N.R., and spent an arduous winter's training in Stevenson's
favourite Edinburgh. Then selections for active
service were made, and Corporal Gallinshaw's name was
not among them. The men sailed from England late in
the spring; and shortly after leaving port a stowaway was
found. It was Gallinshaw. He wanted experience, and
not even the fear of martial law prevented him from getting
what he considered his share of the fun. The <i>Megantic</i>
landed her troops, and for the first few weeks on
Turkish soil, the preliminary baptism of fire once over,
things went on in the old round of dullness, for life in the
trenches at Gallipoli became very monotonous, as stereotyped
as life at any popular seaside resort.</p>

<p>Then snipers began to make themselves all agreeable.
One of them, in particular, gave our fellows a good deal
of trouble. This sniper, armed with an old German
needle-gun, rarely missed his aim. One day Corporal
Gallinshaw, on duty in the trench, had occasion in the
early hours of dawn to repair some wire entanglements
that had been badly wrecked by shell-fire. He had not
been long at his work when the crack of the deadly
needle-gun reminded him of the close proximity of the
sniper. A bullet flung up a rain of stones in his face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Altering his position, he set to work again, this time
more warily, but not warily enough for the sniper. Another
report rang out, and this time a bullet penetrated
his lungs. While he lay bleeding in front of the trench,
some of the Newfoundlanders took it into their heads to
go out and bring in the sniper. They returned before
the sun was up with a gagged and bound figure. It was
the sniper. Now, Newfoundlanders are notoriously democratic,
and they wanted to take the law into their own
hands and hang the captive.</p>

<p>"It's the rule with snipers," said one. "They expect
no mercy."</p>

<p>"String him up," said another. "He's been caught red-handed."</p>

<p>"Give the poor devil a chance," exclaimed Gallinshaw,
whose wounds were being bound up.</p>

<p>"As much chance as he gave you," responded one of
his companions, ironically. Apparently, however, Gallinshaw's
words were heeded, for nothing drastic was
done until an officer came along and examined the prisoner.
Then, to everyone's astonishment, the captive was
found to be a woman. She was a young woman, too,
and of prepossessing appearance. The officer decided she
should be sent to Egypt. Learning this decision, the captive
was full of gratitude towards the corporal for his
intercession. But neither the man nor the woman could
make themselves understood. And thus this romance of
real life ended. But who knows what <i>might</i> have happened,
had the affair been properly conducted&mdash;say by
Seton Merriman, Stanley Weyman, or some other romantic
novelist?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the 3rd London General Hospital recently I was
shown two X-ray photographs, illustrating what may be
considered a miracle of modern surgery. The first plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
depicted Private Coleheart's leg, shattered by Turkish
gunfire; the second picture, taken after the smashed
bone had been welded to a silver plate, showed the leg
practically as good as ever. When I saw Coleheart his
thin, pinched face glowed with happiness over the skill
of the surgeon, and for the first time during our hospital
acquaintance of many months he was inclined to talk.</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;THE TRAGEDY OF THE YOUNG BRIDE</p>

<p>In Egypt, while the 8th Battalion A.I.F. was under
training, the men worked very hard indeed. Marches
over the desert for fourteen hours at a stretch were not
uncommon. When the troops returned at night they were
too tired for any other relaxation than sleep. One evening,
however, it was rumored that the <i>fiancée</i> of a corporal
in Private Coleheart's platoon had come into Mena
Camp. She had landed at Suez from Melbourne the
previous day and had journeyed direct to Cairo. She
had been unable to endure the long separation from her
lover.</p>

<p>The corporal, obtaining three days' leave, married her.
On the second day of the honeymoon, however, he was
wired for to return immediately to Mena. The regiment
was proceeding to Alexandria to embark for the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>Husband and wife said good-bye, and the corporal
sailed from Egypt with a heavy heart. During the voyage
out he was sick, lying in his bunk the whole time
until the ship arrived at Anzac. When his men fell in on
deck he was too ill to make more than a perfunctory
examination of their kits. From the sergeant, however,
he learned that two men from a draft had been dispatched
to the regiment at the last moment to complete its war
establishment. One of them looked curiously familiar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
but the corporal was too unwell to bother about trifles
at that moment.</p>

<p>They were all sent almost at once to the trenches,
where&mdash;unlike the troops in France, who often spend no
more than four days in their burrows&mdash;three weeks and
even longer was the customary time for soldiers to be
entrenched at a stretch.</p>

<p>One of the two new hands, a slight little fellow named
Whitening, found considerable difficulty in fetching up
the supplies of water for his comrades. He seemed to
have no grit in him, too, when the bullets were whizzing
round, and appeared to have neither strength of frame
nor strength of mind. Coleheart often saw him crying
softly to himself at night. At last, in the early summer
of last year, the Turks made their great onslaught on our
trenches. They peppered the ground first with their great
guns, and charged with fierce Oriental bravery, despising
death as much as they seemed to despise our own preparations
for driving them off. They came on in droves, and
they were beaten down in herds, for our quick-firers
and machine-guns never had a better target.</p>

<p>At length, when they were almost over our trenches,
their hearts failed them. They broke and turned tail in
headlong flight. It was then that Coleheart and his companions
were ordered out to disperse the flying enemy.
But the Turkish guns had already opened on both friend
and foe. Within a few yards of the trench Coleheart
fell, his leg mangled horribly. Now it is well known that
during a charge soldiers must leave their wounded comrades
bleeding on the ground and await the final decision
of arms before the injured may be tended. This latter
duty is the care of the Red Cross men and the stretcher-bearers
of a regiment.</p>

<p>To Coleheart's surprise, however, he was picked up
and helped along by one of his comrades to a first-line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
dressing-station. Coleheart saw that his companion was
Whitening.</p>

<p>"You'll get into trouble," he said, feebly. "You're not
supposed to fall out. You'll be court-martialled."</p>

<p>"I don't care!" responded the other, fiercely. "My
husband's just been killed. He was Corporal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And before the astonished Coleheart could respond,
"Whitening" had snatched up the rifle, which had previously
formed a rough splint around Coleheart's leg, and
was dashing back to the trenches.</p>

<p>The surgeon in the dressing-station decided to amputate
the injured leg, but Coleheart was obdurate. He was
born with that leg, he said, and he would die with it.
Patched up, he was soon afterwards put on a hospital
ship, and finally arrived in London.</p>

<p>"But what became of 'Whitening'?" I asked, curious
to learn the end of the history.</p>

<p>"Killed the same day," responded Coleheart. "It never
got into the papers. The whole business was hushed
up."</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;STORY OF THE HERMIT OF YPRES</p>

<p>All readers of Sir Walter Scott's novels will recollect
Old Mortality, the itinerant antiquary, whose craze it
was to clean the moss from gravestones and keep their
letters and effigies in good condition. Private R. Walker,
of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, told me
the following story concerning a very similar character.</p>

<p>You have probably heard how the Canadians have
brought the spirit of the trapper to the trenches; of their
patience in marking down their prey. The enemy never
know what the Canadians will be about next, and for a
wealth of reasons one imagines that to be opposite the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Canadian trenches in Flanders must be a nerve-racking
experience.</p>

<p>The boys from the land of the Maple Leaf are particularly
patient in sapping and mining. They burrow vertical
shafts far under the depths at which they estimate
the Germans will counter-mine; they destroy the enemy's
galleries and, creating a series of craters, occupy them
and connect them up with the nearest Canadian trenches.</p>

<p>In these mining operations the Canadians have obtained
a good deal of information concerning the enemy's
moves from an old fellow they call "Gravestones." His
chief occupation is the preservation of the rows of
wooden crosses denoting the last resting place of the
fallen. The old man's history is passing strange. He
is a Belgian. His daughter, prior to the war, had taken
the veil, but when the country was invaded the cloisters
of most of the convents and monasteries of Belgium were
deserted. The men took up arms; the women helped in
the hospitals.</p>

<p>"Gravestones" lived at Genappe, in Brabant. When
his daughter joined him, from her convent, he took flight
to Gembroux, hoping to reach the French border, but
the party was intercepted by the Germans. The old man,
pretending to lose the power of articulate speech, was
set free. Meanwhile the daughter, during the cross-examination
of her father, had taken shelter in the old
church of the village. Thither she was pursued by some
of the German soldiers.</p>

<p>When they entered the church the girl was hiding by
the altar; but in alarm, as the soldiers advanced towards
her, she seized the great gilt cross surmounting the altar
itself and threatened to hurl it down upon the first man
who approached her.</p>

<p>Thereupon one of the sergeants ordered his men to
open fire upon her, as an example to certain of the villagers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
who had also taken refuge in the building. Perhaps
the men felt the influence of the sacred precincts
they had violated; perhaps they respected the girl's bravery.
Anyway, they fired low. The girl was not killed,
but fell under the altar, both her legs riddled with bullets.</p>

<p>To-day she is believed to be in hospital at Namur,
though no accurate information is obtainable. Meanwhile,
her father, once a prosperous <i>fabricant</i> of paper at
Genappe, works out a slow and terrible scheme of revenge.
Lovingly he plants flowers and shrubs on the graves of
those who have helped to defeat the Huns, and incidentally
he supplies the living with information of the utmost
value. Living among some ruins outside Ypres, the bent
old fellow is known to all but the Canadians as the "Hermit
of Ypres."</p>


<p>IX&mdash;TALE OF THE LOVERS' TREACHERY</p>

<p>When the Germans first poured over France, trenches
were dug at frequent intervals behind Paris and right
down towards the great seaport of Havre. Later on these
earthworks were strengthened and completed by the labour
section of the Army Service Corps. A member of
the Corps, Private Ronald Barrow, tells the following
experience in connection with the work round Etretat.
This village lies in a rock-bound valley, at the end of
which is an old Gothic church named St. Vallery.</p>

<p>The ruins of this church were at first ordered to be
destroyed in order to give a clear sweep for the guns,
but the colonel of Engineers in charge decided not to
proceed with this demolition. Hard by the ruins was a
tiny <i>auberge</i>, and it was here that Private Barrow encountered
Chrysale Duigin.</p>

<p>Barrow had been a school-teacher; and his knowledge
of French gave him the opportunity of making the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
woman's acquaintance. Witty, shrewd, spiteful, she was
nevertheless a most interesting personage, for she was
beautiful, possessed means, and was full of little touches
of wisdom.</p>

<p>Chrysale had two lovers; one a fisherman, a rough,
strong fellow, the other a puny little conscript, who, in
happier days, collected taxes. Hervé, the conscript, had
been invalided home from Verdun, having lost his right
arm. Galen, the fisherman, was exempt from military
service. Between the two there was naturally a great
rivalry. Hervé said much, and did nothing; Galen said
nothing, and brooded.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood, until one evening Galen embarked
on an armed trawler that had been fitted out at the port
to seek for mines floating down the Channel towards
Havre. He had become a <i>matelot</i> in the French navy.
One morning at dawn the vessel was struck by a mine
outside the very roads of Etretat. Putting out, the lifeboat
saved only one man&mdash;Galen, the fisherman. In rescuing
him one man was lost overboard. That man was
Hervé, Chrysale's lover, and Galen's rival in her affections.
Nothing more was seen of him. A heavy sea was
running, and he must have been carried away by the
tide.</p>

<p>When Galen was brought ashore he was still unconscious.
On his head was a deep wound, where he had
been struck by a boat-hook handled by one of the rescuers.
Taken to his house, Galen lay at death's door for
some days, but his great physical strength pulled him
through. They saved his life, but not his reason; his
brain had become hopelessly deranged.</p>

<p>A fortnight later Barrow, who knew the principal actors
in the pitiful tale, saw one of the crew of the lifeboat.
In the meantime, Barrow had been employed on
the docks at Havre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a sad enough story," said the fisherman, in response
to Barrow's questioning. "It's a pity we ever
took young Hervé aboard with us."</p>

<p>"But Hervé did his best," responded Barrow. "He
gave his life for Galen."</p>

<p>"He gave his life, sure enough," grunted the fisherman;
"but he gave it unconsciously, unwillingly. It
was Hervé that struck Galen the blow with the boat-hook.
Every man of the crew saw it was done with
purpose."</p>

<p>Barrow understood it all. Hervé had struck at his
rival, and Galen had pulled his man overboard to perish.
Thus love and jealousy flourish just as lustily in wartime
as in the piping days of peace.</p>


<p>X&mdash;STORY OF THE MAN WHO DISAPPEARED</p>

<p>I met Manech Argouarch for the second time at Brest
some six years ago. My friend who keeps the <i>Civette
Nantaise</i> in the Rue de Siam&mdash;probably the only place
in Brest where cigars are sold in smokable condition&mdash;has
kept me informed from time to time concerning interesting
items of local history. From his letters I have
put together the story of Manech. When I knew the
man he was a wild, dissolute fellow, but, like many vagabonds,
fortune had endowed him with a charming mate.
Ten years younger than Manech, she was a tiny wisp
of a woman. As far as I could judge, the pair were
happy together in their own way.</p>

<p>When the war had run its course for some months
Argouarch found his fishing-boat sadly short-handed, for
the crews of most of the fishing-vessels were taken as
conscripts. At this juncture Elène, his wife, went aboard,
and did what she could to help.</p>

<p>It chanced that one day in the spring of last year a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
gale sprang up suddenly when they were a long way out
at sea. A terrific sea got up, and Manech had to heave-to
as best he could, and endeavour to ride out the storm.
Early in the morning the gale broke. The wind moderated
sensibly, but the swell was still exceedingly heavy.
Meanwhile the little boat was in a sorry plight, with one
of the masts down and the rigging lying tangled over the
deck.</p>

<p>Soon after nine o'clock in the morning Manech saw
the periscope of a submarine away on the port bow.
Emerging from the water, the sinister craft drew alongside,
and a young German lieutenant came aboard. He
wanted provisions and fresh water. Realizing the futility
of resistance Manech and the boy Becsalé brought
up on deck the whole of their available supplies. The
German, however, was not satisfied. He said he would
search the craft himself.</p>

<p>Elène had been instructed to hide herself in the tiny
cabin, and when the German climbed down the hatchway,
thinking he would probably seek to do her harm,
she took up a big clasp-knife from the table and hid it
in the folds of her dress. The German's search proved
without avail, but he was more than interested in the
pretty Elène. He seized her hand, and attempted to kiss
it, but Elène wrenched herself from his grasp, and in a
second stood in a corner of the cabin, holding the knife
to her breast, and threatening to plunge it into her bosom
if he attempted to approach. She was too terrified to
scream.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Argouarch, who had been aloft furling a
small storm stay-sail, descended into the cabin, wondering
what had become of the German. When he saw his
wife with the knife at her breast he hurled himself on
the German in mad rage. The fight was short and fierce.
Hearing the scuffle, three German sailors who were on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
deck hurried down, overpowered the unfortunate Manech
and bore him, more dead than alive, into the submarine.
Then one of their look-out men reported a vessel away
on the lee bow, steaming hard towards them. It was a
French destroyer. Within a few moments the submarine
submerged again, and speedily disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>Elène came into harbour soon afterwards, a French
sailor being put aboard to navigate the crippled fishing-boat
to safety. For days after her arrival in Brest there
were stories about as to an enemy submarine having been
sunk by a French torpedo craft, but nothing definite is
known.</p>

<p>As to the fate of Manech, nothing whatever has been
heard. But every day Elène is out early upon the highest
cliff, peering through the sea mist across Brest Roads.
Her companions are lonely women whose husbands and
lovers have been swallowed up by the sea. They strain
their eyes over the waters, hoping against hope, but their
search is always in vain.</p>


<p>XI&mdash;TALE OF THE RESCUE FROM THE AIR</p>

<p>For the dashing exploit next described, Lieutenant
Pétri, of the French Aerial Service, received the Military
Cross. It was during the tragic period when the British
Naval Division had evacuated Antwerp. Somewhere
near Bruges a large party of cavalry, which included the
Royal Horse Guards, met the fugitives. Above them a
French biplane hovered. A splinter of shell had killed
the observer. Lieutenant Pétri piloted the machine.
Hard by the town of Eecloo he perceived a score of tiny
ant-men fleeing along the road towards Waerschoot.
These would have attracted Pétri's attention before had
not his engine commenced miss-firing. For a time it
seemed on the point of refusing action altogether, but at
last he got it going again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>It was then, when the biplane had come quite close
to the earth, that he became aware of an exciting chase
beneath. The cape of a woman first caught his eye.
She was mounted on a horse, and was galloping away at
breakneck speed from half-a-dozen Uhlans, who, with
lances poised, were pursuing her. In a flash Pétri had
man&oelig;uvred his machine over the horsemen. A lever was
pulled, and the roar of an explosion right among the
Uhlans told of the success of his aim. As he descended
Pétri observed that one of the soldiers had managed to
make good his escape. In all probability he had gone
for reinforcements. There was no time to lose. The
machine came to earth near the woman, who had dismounted.</p>

<p>"You have come to make me a prisoner?" she cried,
in French. She was very beautiful, with dark curls of
chestnut hair floating in the wind.</p>

<p>"I have come to take you," answered Pétri, touching
his cap, "but not as a prisoner&mdash;as a passenger, if
mam'selle will permit."</p>

<p>In horror she pointed to the observer, whose head hung
loosely on his breast.</p>

<p>"Poor Fanchon has been shot," answered the lieutenant.
Tearing away the straps that held the poor fellow
securely in his seat, Pétri laid him reverently on a mound
of grass by the roadside.</p>

<p>This was no occasion for ceremony. Very soon the
girl's horse was cantering riderless along the road, and
the engine was roaring again as the plane rose up towards
the clouds.</p>

<p>When they had mounted some five hundred feet into
the air the passenger pointed with almost fearful interest
at another group proceeding along the road they had just
quitted. The Uhlan was returning, with probably a
score of companions. They promptly opened fire on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
machine, but by this time the biplane was out of their
reach.</p>

<p>When Pétri regained the French lines it was found
that the woman was the bearer of important despatches.
There was no more to relate, for Horace tells us that
romance ends with marriage, and Pétri was already a
married man when our story opens.</p>


<p>XII&mdash;ROMANCE IN THE BRITISH NAVY</p>

<p>Some years ago Henry Lawe joined the Royal Navy
as a carpenter's mate. While on the Australian Station
he deserted, but was arrested, homeward bound, at Malta.
Here, while waiting for a ship to return him to Australia,
he made the acquaintance of a young woman, a
lady's companion. A warm friendship quickly ensued,
which developed into something more romantic, and before
long there was an "understanding" between the pair.
At this juncture, however, a light cruiser bound for the
Antipodes put into the harbour, and the deserter Lawe
was sent back to Sydney.</p>

<p>Life in His Majesty's ships on the Australian Station
was quite uncongenial to him, so he deserted for the
second time. He worked at his old trade in an assumed
name, and prospered. Meanwhile letters were passing
between himself and his lady of Malta. Before anything
definite had been settled war broke out, and&mdash;a free pardon
being granted to all deserters&mdash;Lawe joined the Australian
Army Corps as a private in the 15th Battalion.
In due course he reached the Dardanelles, where he was
wounded in the knee. By a stroke of good luck the hospital
ship on which he sailed for home, instead of putting
her wounded ashore at Alexandria, steamed straight
through the Mediterranean. Nearing Malta, wireless signals
were picked up which instructed the vessel to land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
her wounded on the island, as it was dangerous for ships
to proceed up the English Channel on account of drifting
mines.</p>

<p>Private Lawe was put ashore at Malta, and lost no
time in endeavoring to get into communication with his
fair correspondent. She had, however, left her situation,
and to his grief he was unable to trace her whereabouts.</p>

<p>It happened a few days later that an admiral's daughter
visited the hospital and, hearing part of Lawe's story,
took an interest in him. Finding that the crutches he
was using were hurting his arms, she purchased a specially
comfortable pair for him at her own expense. These
she sent to the hospital by her companion.</p>

<p>The sequel? Well, you have, no doubt, guessed it. The
young lady's maid was Lawe's little maid, and so the
lovers were united again.</p>


<p>XIII&mdash;THE TRAGEDY OF RANNOU COLBERT</p>

<p>Less fortunate is the sequel of Rannou Colbert's adventure.
He was a bellringer at Quimper Cathedral before
the war. Exempt from military service, he joined
the Colonial Infantry, a corps of paid professional soldiers,
entirely distinct from conscripts. Originally equivalent
to our marines, these regiments no longer serve
aboard ship, but garrison the overseas possessions of
France. The company in which Colbert was serving
fought by the side of our Ghurkas at the Dardanelles.
There Private J. Threadgold, of the 7th Royal Fusiliers,
made Colbert's acquaintance. Our men exchanged some
of their bully-beef ration with the French against cigarettes,
and Colbert understood enough English to act as
interpreter in many small international bargains. Colbert's
name is scratched on a silver match-box in Threadgold's
possession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>On the night that Threadgold was wounded an attack
had been made on our trenches by the Turks. The
enemy was beaten off. Early the next morning a party of
the Turks crawled between our sentries in the Indian
lines and slew two Ghurkas. Only one of the enemy
was wounded, and he was taken prisoner. From him it
was learnt that the attacking party was eighteen strong.
That day the Ghurkas became tremendously excited.
They sharpened their curved knives and talked closely
together. They were plotting, and it was spread along
the line from mouth to mouth that an adventure was
afoot. That same evening after sunset exactly eighteen
Ghurkas crept from the entrenchments, and they were
joined by a man from the French regiment of Colonial
Infantry, Rannou Colbert. The party wound their way
through the scrub towards the Turkish trenches. They
were gone an hour; then, chattering and gesticulating
in intense joy, they all returned in safety except one
man. They had killed eighteen Turks. The one man
missing was Rannou Colbert, who had been taken prisoner.</p>

<p>No more was heard of Colbert until some months later,
when a poignant little history appeared in the <i>Matin</i>. It
is unknown whether Colbert escaped from the Turks, or
whether he was an exchanged prisoner. During his imprisonment
he was, for some reason, not allowed to write
home, and as his name was not furnished by the Turkish
authorities to the French he was posted as missing.</p>

<p>At Bordeaux, whence he arrived from Lemnos, he
landed without money, and consequently could not telegraph
to his wife. During the whole of the journey to
Quimper, however, he relished keenly the thought of the
pleasure he would see on her face when she saw him. Of
his two children, too, he thought, anticipating gleefully
the welcome they would give him. He sailed on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
coasting vessel, one of those that bring the red wine
from Bordeaux to Brittany. Into the River Odet at last
they came, and its banks became narrower and steeper
until Quimper hove in sight, the twin towers of St. Corenten
showing warm and venerable in the waning light. His
home was in the Rue Kéréron, a mediæval street of old
mansions. Trembling with excitement, Colbert lifted the
latch. There was nobody in the passage, but from the
kitchen he heard the merry laugh of a happy family
circle. He recognized Babette's laugh&mdash;and another
man's. Listening, he distinguished the latter as that of
his friend, Maurice, a potter who turned lumps of clay
into Quimper faience.</p>

<p>It is a sad little story, the rest of it. Her husband
being given up as dead, Babette, with scarcely sufficient
money to buy bread for her children, had married
Maurice. Rannou did not chide her; in the circumstances
he considered she had done the obvious thing. She was
broken-hearted and so was he. That night he left for
Concarneau. He saw that his wife and Maurice had
sufficient money to live on; and he, a cripple, did not
wish to burden her. He determined to earn what he
could and live his own life.</p>

<p>He managed to secure a berth at Concarneau, where
he had relations, and was employed on the quays, checking
the giant mackerel unloaded from the tunny-boats.
Some time later, hearing that Maurice had fallen out of
work, Rannou sent to his old home as much as he could
spare from his scanty earnings. Truly the ways of men
are passing strange! One day, perhaps, Maurice will
die; and Rannou will return to Quimper and to the
Babette who loves him still.</p>

<h2>THE IRISHMEN OF THE FIGHTING
TENTH AT MACEDONIA</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Told by One of the Fighting Irishmen</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>This is a spirited story of how the heroic Tenth (Irish) Division
saved the situation for the Allies in retreat from Macedonia
to Salonica. It is told for the first time by the <i>London Weekly
Despatch</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;TALES OF THE IRISHMEN AND THE
BULGARS</p>

<p>On December 3, which was a Friday, the British outposts
brought in six Bulgar deserters who had much of
interest to tell. They said that the Bulgars not only had
suffered very heavily in their engagements with the Serbians
but were losing men rapidly owing to sickness and
frostbite.</p>

<p>What is more to the point, they warned the officers
that a big attack against our line was impending, that it
had been arranged to take place that day but that the
severe snowstorm had caused them to put it off to another
day which would not be long delayed.</p>


<p><i>March, 1916.</i></p>

<p>These opportune tidings which as events proved were
thoroughly reliable, were communicated to headquarters
and the necessary precautions for battle taken. The outposts
were drawn in and finishing touches given to the
trenches.</p>

<p>The night before the great Bulgar attack began one of
the battalions held a pow-wow in their dug-outs, which
they had covered in with a big tarpaulin that hid the
smoke of a matchwood fire, lit for cheerfulness as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
as for warmth. There was little in their surroundings
to make them happy, but their own lively spirits allowed
them to triumph over their environment and the night
passed pleasantly in song.</p>

<p>In that bleak corner of the Balkans thousands of miles
from home Englishmen sang themselves happy with sentimental
and topical ditties. If a program had been
printed it would have run like this:</p>

<p>Song, "My Little Gray Home in the West."</p>

<p>Mouth organ solo, "Who Were You With Last
Night?"</p>

<p>Song, "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling."</p>

<p>Whistling solo, "Stop Your Tickling, Jock."</p>

<p>Interval for refreshments (tea, bully beef and biscuit
sandwiches, jam sandwiches, etc.)</p>

<p>Song, "Yiddle on Your Fiddle."</p>

<p>Mouth organ solo, "Tipperary."</p>

<p>Song, "Are We All Here?"</p>

<p>Note.&mdash;Smoking allowed in all parts of the house.</p>

<p>Though the West Kents thus amused themselves and
put many a shy comrade who refused to sing "in the
oven," there was a feeling that danger was near. Instinct
proved unerring.</p>

<p>The Tenth Division stood to all night, so that if the
enemy came in the morning they would not find their
hosts unprepared. In the first trenches were the Connaughts,
the Munsters, the Dublin Fusiliers, the Hampshires
and the Inniskillings, the latter to a large extent
Ulster men holding the extreme right wing.</p>

<p>Dawn had scarcely broken when the enemy made his
expected attack. The conditions wholly favored him, for
a fairly dense fog prevailed, and under its cover the
Bulgars were able to get within 300 yards of parts of our
line without being observed. The Inniskillings were the
first to be attacked; about 5 A. M. their outposts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
driven in and then a great mass of the enemy swooped
down on the trenches, but were driven back by the fire
of our Maxim guns and by the steady magazine fire that
came from the trenches.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the attack on the extreme right of our
line had time to develop when the main body of Bulgars
were seen running down a defile leading to the center
of our front. They were perceived as a long, interminable
stretch of men&mdash;a mass of shadowy figures revealed
half distinctly in the mist. As they reached the end of
the defile they spread out as from a bottle neck, and with
wild cheers flung themselves on our line. But before they
had got so far our guns smashed and battered the thick
procession of men leaping out of the narrow gorge. It
was impossible to miss them. British artillery had never
had such a target since the first battle of Ypres, when
the guns literally mowed down the half-trained German
troops who attacked on the Yser.</p>

<p>The slaughter of the guns was magnified by the slaughter
of the rapid magazine fire at short range. Wave after
wave of the enemy came on, each broken as it swept out
of the defile, but the Bulgars were not to be denied.
Though their comrades fell thick and fast they came on,
and by sheer impetus of numbers reached our trenches,
where awful work was wrought. It was hand to hand
fighting then&mdash;terrible to witness, terrible to think of.
The short bayonet of the Bulgar, however, was of little
use in these trench combats, and man for man the British
won, but the Bulgars had the numbers and temporarily
the first line of the Twelfth Division was overborne.
The British were driven out.</p>

<p>The British artillery had been doing splendid work,
but by now the enemy artillery was in full blast, and
they poured a devastating and withering hail of fire on
our positions, which through faulty ranging put out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
action more of the Bulgars than it did of us. The Munsters
and the Connaughts and the Dublins quickly rallied,
and with a wonderful bayonet charge drove the enemy
out of their trenches again. The enemy, massed in close
formation, swarmed in once more, but against the deadly
fire poured into them they could make no headway for
some time. The brave Irish regiments were pouring
lead into them as fast as they could load their rifles. They
poured into the oncoming masses as much as 175 rounds
at pointblank range. This will give an idea of the
slaughter that went on this December morning, as the
dawn slowly beat the mists away.</p>


<p>II&mdash;CRIES OF HALF-MADDENED BULGARS</p>

<p>Mingling with the roar of the artillery and the clitter-clatter
of the machine guns and the sharp snap of the
rifles were the hoarse cries of the half maddened Bulgars,
whose officers ever drove them on to the death that
came quick and hot from the British trenches. Men of
splendid physique they were that faced our hail of lead,
cheering in a sort of wild euthanasia of battle, with bugles
and trumpets blowing defiant challenge as in the knightly
days of the tourney. They did not know, many of them,
whether they were attacking French, British or Turk,
but unquestioning, unthinking, they came on with a fearlessness
of life deserving of a better cause, leaping into
our trenches and falling back dead with a bullet in the
throat or a bayonet wound in the breast or with head
blown off by one of our shells.</p>

<p>But it was, "for all our grim resistance," a hopeless
kind of struggle. Sooner or later that unceasing stream
of men issuing out of the narrow defile must sweep us
back. Always the enemy returned to the charge, undeterred
by heavy losses, undismayed by our deadly gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
and magazine fire. The line held, and to their cheers
we answered with our own cheers, and to their cries we
gave back answer with our own cries, and if sometimes
the thin line faltered the shouts of officers and men,
"Stick it, jolly boys! Give 'em hell, Connaughts!"
brought new life and new strength.</p>

<p>In the end we gave the enemy his dearly bought line
of trenches and slowly fell back to our second line of
positions, where the remainder of the divison joined up
and helped us to beat off the sustained attacks, which
lacked naught in violence. All day the Bulgars alternately
bombarded and charged us. There seemed to be
thousands and thousands of them. They gave us no rest
at night. Wherever we stood they rained an unceasing
fusillade of shell upon us and followed each rafale up
with a determined infantry attack.</p>

<p>Outnumbering the Tenth Division in the proportion of
at least eight to one, they were obstinately bent on its
destruction at whatever cost to themselves. Their artillery
far exceeded ours in weight of metal, but in effectiveness
there was no comparison. Almost all our shells
told, while many of theirs did no more than splinter the
rocks yards away. So Monday, December 6, was passed
with the Tenth Division mightily pressed but still well
able to hold its own. Tuesday the 7th was an exact
replica of the previous day.</p>

<p>The Bulgars heavily bombarded our line; then sent
forward strong storming parties before whom we recoiled
a little, but no more. The division never lost its
cohesion, and it gave ground only at the rate of two
miles a day, which is a proof, if any were needed, of the
splendid rearguard action that this much outnumbered
force fought. Our artillery kept them in sufficient check
to give us all the respite we needed, and the rifle fire of
the different regiments bit gaping wounds in the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
mass that helped to throw them into temporary confusion.</p>

<p>Teodorow, the Bulgarian General, is a great believer
in the German method of attack. He reckons no loss in
men is too great if the objective be gained. The objective
in this case was the decimation of the Tenth Division,
and under his orders the Bulgars charged and charged
until the snowdrifts over which the battle was fought were
black with the recumbent forms of his men.</p>


<p>III&mdash;"WE OUTLIVED THE HORRORS OF
SULVA"</p>

<p>We fought as at Mons. The arrowhead of the division
consisting of two or three regiments, the Dublins, the
Munsters and the Connaughts, took the shock of the
enemy attacks, while the sides made good their retirement,
then the arrowhead rapidly fell back and joined us
with the main body, while other regiments received the
shock in turn.</p>

<p>In the two days we drew four miles nearer to the
Greek frontier. If we could continue to maintain this
deliberate rate of retirement with our formations still
intact we could hope for salvation, for we knew that re-enforcements
were due.</p>

<p>The night of the 7th the Bulgars made a final attempt
to smash our resistance. They redoubled the force of
their bombardment; they increased still more the momentum
of their infantry attacks. They came very near
to achieving their purpose, and there were hours when
one would have asked prayers for the Tenth Division,
but British bulldog courage and obstinacy withstood all
the fury of the enemy's onset, and our mountain artillery
always found an easy target. By the 8th the force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
of the Bulgar attacks had spent itself.... In the two
days' battle the Tenth Division inflicted on the enemy at
least four times their own number of casualties and, what
is possibly of equal importance, they taught him the temper
and morale of British infantry....</p>

<p>The Tenth Division outlived the horrors of Sulva; it
outlived the days and nights of biting cold on the Serbian
frontier ranges, and it finished the miracle, to quote the
official phrase, by "sustaining violent attacks delivered
by the enemy in overwhelming numbers." The slow, punishing,
rearguard action it fought allowed the Allies to
withdraw all their accumulated stores and munitions and
to fall back without congestion into Greek territory
again.</p>

<p>The Tenth Division saved the situation by a display
of courage and dogged heroism that cannot be too highly
praised. One of these days we shall be told what the
general said to the thinned units when he met them again
at Salonica....</p>

<p>You ask the most talkative of them to give you a picture
of the oncoming Bulgar masses.</p>

<p>"A mad, swearing mob, they were," he says, "on us as
thick as ants. I suppose they were swearing. Anyhow,
we couldn't understand their lingo, and they didn't say
much after we had let them have five rounds of rapid
fire." You ask another what he said when the Bulgars
stormed the trench. "Said?" is the reply, "said? I never
said anything. I was too busy pumping hell into them
to say anything. But my pal was shouting hard enough
for me and him as well." Get men with that spirit and
neither Bulgar nor German shall best them.</p>

<p>It is hard to explain how the Tenth Division, encompassed
as it was, won through, and perhaps the most satisfactory
thing to do is to fall back on the explanation of
a Munster Fanger, whose only grumble is that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
kept twelve hours in those terrible forty-eight hours'
fighting without food.</p>

<p>"They beat us with numbers. We couldn't hope to hold
up against the crowd they sent against us, a daft, clumsy
gang of men. We gave 'em hell, but their numbers beat
us. But two days wasn't much of a time to give theirselves
to make us see we were beaten, and so we got away
with them still coming after us. You'd got to be there
to see what happened." It sounds very much like an
anti-climax, but it is really what happened. The Tenth
Division escaped because it hadn't time to know that by
all the rules it was beaten.</p>

<h2>THE ARTIFICIAL VOLCANO</h2>

<div class="center"><i>An incident of the Italian Campaign in the
Dolomites</i><br />
<br />
<i>Related by Capitano Z&mdash;&mdash;, of the Royal Italian
Engineers</i>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>No more spectacular feat has been accomplished in the present
war than the taking of the Col di Lana, a great peak whose
summit, towering above the Upper Cordevole Valley and commanding
the main highway through the Dolomites, was for
many months held by the Austrians. How the steel-clad crest
of the Col was wrested from the enemy is here set forth in
detail. The narrator's name is suppressed at his own request
in his reminiscences in the <i>Wide World Magazine</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE ROYAL ENGINEERS</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve, 1915, and we officers of the
Royal Italian Engineers were huddled together in a
trench, doing our best, at that chilly elevation of some
seven thousand eight hundred feet, to keep ourselves
warm. Not a word had been spoken for fully a quarter
of an hour. We were all intent, in the semi-darkness of
our subterranean refuge, on the smoking of our pipes,
turning over and over in our minds meanwhile the problem
which had faced us for months past.</p>

<p>Entrusted with the task, amidst that wilderness of
mountains known as the Dolomite Alps, of driving back
the Austrians, we had been fighting our way forward
week after week, month after month. You say that you
have never done any climbing in the Dolomites? Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
you can have but a faint idea of how formidable our work
was.</p>

<p>Imagine, since you have never been there, a seemingly
endless succession of ranges and peaks which have assumed
the most extraordinary and fantastic forms. The
mountains are broken up into every imaginable shape.
Here and there they rise at a bound in the form of slender
peaks; elsewhere they assume the form of gigantic steps
or pyramids or indented crests, sometimes like a saw, at
others like a trident.</p>

<p>Through this land of towering, snow-clad summits,
mighty gorges, rugged precipices, and apparently bottomless
abysses, into which the unwary scout might at any
moment find himself precipitated, we soldiers and engineers
of the Italian army had steadily fought our way.
No one, gazing on these summits held by our enemies,
would ever have thought it possible to dislodge them.
And yet, one by one, they fell into our hands&mdash;with the
single exception of the Col di Lana, a supreme peak and
pass in the Upper Cordevole Valley which, at the altitude
I have named, commands the great highway through the
Dolomites.</p>

<p>On this topmost peak the Austrians had found a last
refuge. Daily&mdash;almost hourly, indeed&mdash;they sent down
upon us an avalanche of boulders and hand-grenades.
In spite of this we managed on one occasion to gain a
foothold, but only for a short time. A withering fire
from artillery and machine-guns, placed on the encircling
heights, forced us back to the security of our own trenches,
some fifty yards below; and there we had been, at the
time my story opens, for many weeks, faced with the
eternal problem&mdash;how to dislodge the enemy from the
steel-clad crest of the mountain. Suddenly the meditative
silence into which we had fallen was broken by Don
Gelasio Caetani, a young engineer who is the son of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Duca di Sermoneta and an English lady. Well known
for his patriotism and professional ability, we knew that
anything he might have to say would be well worth listening
to, so at the sound of his voice we all looked up.</p>

<p>"<i>Ho un idéa!</i>" ("An idea occurs to me!") he said,
slowly and impressively. "I was day-dreaming of my native
Naples and Vesuvius," he added. "To a Neapolitan,
Vesuvius is everything. He regards it as possessing almost
a personality, endowed with life and thought. He
watches it, year after year, as I have done, and notes the
changes its form has undergone through successive eruptions.
The thought of Vesuvius gave me my idea. What
do you say, <i>amici</i>, if we try and convert the Col di Lana
into an artificial volcano?"</p>

<p>Had Don Gelasio been other than what we knew he
was&mdash;a man noted for extreme fertility of invention and
resource&mdash;we might have been inclined to laugh at him.
But we were all too well aware of his seriousness of mind
to treat his idea as an idle fancy, and as one man we
voiced a request for an explanation of the ways and means
towards the proposed end.</p>

<p>Don Gelasio's pencil and notebook were out in a trice
and, crowding round him, we were soon buried in the
study of a sectional drawing of the Col di Lana, with the
respective positions of the invading and invaded forces
and the distance of one from the other accurately marked.
Lines and figures and calculations, as he explained the
scheme in detail, quickly covered the sides of the sketch,
showing theoretically and mathematically, whatever practice
might prove, that the scheme was feasible.</p>

<p>"It will be a long task," I ventured to remark, when he
had come to the end of his explanations and seemed to
be waiting for our observations; "but if it takes four
months I'm your man. How long do you estimate this
tunnelling will take?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not far short of the time you've named. If we can
do it quicker by putting a few extra men on to the job,
all the better; but I calculate there are three thousand feet
of solid rock to be bored before we can bring off our little
surprise on the enemy. Well, my friend, then I take it
the scheme is agreed upon? We will begin to-morrow&mdash;Christmas
Day; 'the better the day the better the deed.'"</p>

<p>At an early hour on Christmas morning Don Gelasio
Caetani and our corps of engineers, numbering in all
twenty-five, set to work to imitate Nature&mdash;to make the
long preliminary preparations for supplying the bowels of
the earth under the Col di Lana with a power similar to
the pent-up forces of an eruption.</p>


<p>II&mdash;PLANTING DEATH ON THE IRON-CRESTED
PEAK</p>

<p>As soon as the bold and dangerous plan became known
there was no lack of volunteers. We had no difficulty in
forming a band of experienced miners, who worked in
two shifts, never stopping day or night. A powerful perforator
(drill) was got to work under most ingenious
conditions&mdash;in deference to the higher military authorities
I cannot be more precise&mdash;lest its strident voice should
give away the secret of the fate which awaited the enemy
forces on the iron-crested peak.</p>

<p>During the month of January we made excellent progress
with our tunnel into the heart of the mountains, and
were able to form some idea of how long we should be
over the work. Roughly speaking, we found we were
able to bore about seven hundred feet a month. During
February we put on speed, and did considerably over that
length&mdash;not bad work when you consider that each of our
<i>galleria</i> was sufficiently big to allow two men to pass each
other comfortably, and that we were working all the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
in bitter winter weather. But, in spite of our hardships,
all went as merry as a marriage bell until we reached the
early days of March. Up to then the Austrians had suspected
nothing. They showed by what they said during
the occasional truces, which were not uncommon between
the rival trenches, that they considered themselves in perfect
safety. We often heard ironical voices chanting such
taunts as this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"Perhaps you may take Trento,<br />
Perhaps you may take Trieste,<br />
But the Col di Lana&mdash;never!"<br />
</div>

<p>And the chorus of arrogant, cock-sure Austrian soldiers
would vociferate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">"But the Col di Lana&mdash;never!"</div>

<p>When March came in, however, we discovered that the
enemy were becoming suspicious. The steady burrowing
noise of our drills and the thud of our pickaxes awoke
them, as we drew nearer and nearer to their positions, to
the reality of the situation. Soon we became aware that
they had started excavating a counter-mine. Don Gelasio
brought the news to the day-squad with words of encouragement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go ahead, boys!" he said. "Put on speed as much as
you can. It's now a matter of a race for life."</p>

<p>We were now boring slightly upwards, to get as near
as possible to the summit of the Col di Lana, and the turn
matters had taken necessitated an earlier date for the
eruption of our artificial volcano than we had contemplated.
So, after we had been working with feverish
haste for another three weeks, our chief held a council of
war and announced that the fateful day was near.</p>

<p>"To-morrow or the day after we must place the explosive,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
he said. "We shall need ten tons of gelatine and
dynamite. I'm having the extreme end of the <i>galleria</i>,
which cannot be far away now from the enemy's positions,
blocked with a shield of thick armoured steel, in
order to turn the force of the explosion upward, and at
the same time save the remaining portion of the main tunnel
from destruction. I'm counting on that as an open
pathway when the moment comes for rushing the enemy
trenches&mdash;or all that will be left of them. Ah! in spite
of all their tardy attempts to counter-mine us, they little
suspect on what a volcano they are sitting!"</p>

<p>For the dangerous task of leading the way through the
tunnel, directly after the explosion, forty of our bravest
<i>alpini</i> came forward, being promised a fortnight's leave
if the attempt succeeded.</p>

<p>At last everything was ready and the hour fixed&mdash;half-past
eleven on a Tuesday night&mdash;for the firing of the
mine. How the time hung on our hands all that afternoon
and evening!</p>

<p>All the while we wondered what progress the enemy
had made with <i>his</i> boring, asking ourselves whether we
should forestall him or not. More anxious hours I never
passed in my life.</p>

<p>What a relief it was when the hour struck for testing
the efficiency of our work. I can still see Don Gelasio
Caetani as he stood at the wheel of his little electric generator,
ready to give the couple of turns which would set
free the destructive spark. We surrounded him in his
little dugout, waiting with bated breath, for the sound of
the explosion.</p>


<p>III&mdash;"A HELLISH ROAR BURST FORTH"</p>

<p>At last Caetani spun the wheel. Heavens! what a din
ensued! The mountain seemed to be shaken to its very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
base. A hellish roar burst forth and rolled like thunder
over the vast wastes of the Dolomites, and a terrific blast
of air smote upon us even in our shelter.</p>

<p>Out we rushed, to find that the gallant forty, marshalled
at the entrance to the main gallery, had been struck full
in the face by a mighty ice-cold blast, due to the displacement
of air, and that for a few moments they were held
up by a series of after-explosions, caused by the ignition
of the mines which the hapless Austrians had prepared.</p>

<p>One of the men, describing the explosion to me the next
day, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A huge tongue of flame, followed by a mighty column
of smoke, shot into the air, blowing the entire top of the
mountain into the sky. Ah! <i>capitano</i>, it resembled nothing
so much as the eruption of a volcano; and if it is true,
as I am told, that Don Gelasio spoke of imitating Vesuvius,
he could not have chosen a happier image or succeeded
better."</p>

<p>But let me tell you the sequel.</p>

<p>At length the men were able to bound forward in the
darkness towards the enemy trenches. Just at that moment
the moon suddenly beamed forth behind the clouds,
revealing the shattered summit of the Col, heaps of mutilated
bodies, and groups of dumfounded, trembling survivors,
with arms upraised in token of surrender. All
this time our artillery was raining a shower of shells on
the mountain saddle between the Col di Lana and Monte
Sief, with the double object of preventing the flight of the
enemy and their reinforcement. But they were all glad
to give in, being thoroughly unnerved and dazed, and well
aware of the fact that both telegraphic and telephonic
communication with their main forces had been completely
destroyed by the explosion.</p>

<p>It seems that at the fateful hour they happened to have an
extra force on the Col, a company sent specially from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
Sief to relieve the soldiery in the trenches; hence the
large number of victims. Considerably over two hundred
must have been blown to atoms or killed by falling
<i>débris</i>.</p>

<p>But we had no time that night to bother about the
dead and wounded. Our whole attention was directed towards
the prisoners, a first batch of whom, including
four officers, was soon being taken down the mountain
by ten of our brave volunteers. A second batch of five
officers and a hundred and ten men followed soon afterwards.
In addition we took possession of a shattered
mountain gun, cleverly mounted in a cavern and half-a-dozen
equally useless mitrailleuses. Five others, with two
hundred rifles, were intact. Stores of food sufficient to
have lasted the entire garrison for another month completed
our booty.</p>

<p>So ended the affair of the Col di Lana, which will ever
be linked in the Italian annals of the war with the name
of Don Gelasio Caetani, to whom is due a good deal of
the credit of the great advance which, immediately afterwards,
we made along the main highway through the
Dolomites.</p>

<p>This is the official story of the events on the midnight just
before the execution of Edith Cavell, the English nurse, who

here relates how, with the Spanish Minister and a Belgian
counsellor, he went to the house of the German Governor at
Brussels late at night and pleaded with Baron von der Lancken
and the German officers for a stay of execution. The American
Minister, Brand Whitlock, too ill to make the journey himself,
waited at the American Embassy for the results of the mission.
The story is told in the official report to Minister Whitlock,
which was forwarded to the British Government. The narrative
given herewith is from Mr. Gibson's statement in the
<i>World's Work</i>, with introductory reports from other sources.</p></blockquote>

CAVELL</p>

<p>Edith Cavell was an English nurse, daughter of the
late Rev. Frederick Cavell, former Vicar of Swardeston,
Norfolk. The charge against her was aiding Belgians
to escape to England. It is stated she hid them in her
house and provided them with money and addresses in
England and helped to smuggle them across the frontier.</p>

<p>Miss Cavell was confined in prison ten weeks. Her
trial before the military court of Brussels lasted two days.
M. De Leval, Belgian Counsellor for the American Legation,
tells this story:</p>

<p>"Herr Kirschon assured me repeatedly that the Military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Court always was perfectly fair and that he would keep
me informed of all developments in the case, but he
failed to give me any information and after the trial I
learned from other sources the following:</p>

<p>"Miss Cavell was prosecuted for having helped English
and French soldiers, as well as Belgian young men,
to cross the frontier and go to England. She admitted
by signing a statement before the day of the trial and by
public acknowledgment in court that she was guilty of
the charges, not only that she had helped these soldiers
to cross the frontier, but also that some of them had
thanked her in writing when arriving in England.</p>

<p>"This last admission made her case more serious, because
if it had only been proved she had helped soldiers
to traverse the Dutch frontier and no proof was produced
that those soldiers had reached a country at war
with Germany, she could have only been sentenced for
an attempt to commit the crime, and not for the crime
being duly accomplished.</p>

<p>"Miss Cavell, in her oral statement before the court,
disclosed almost all the facts of the prosecution. She
spoke without trembling and showed a clear mind, and
often added some greater precision to her previous depositions.</p>

<p>"When she was asked why she helped these soldiers
to go to England she replied that she thought if she had
not done so they would have been shot by the Germans.
Therefore she thought she only did her duty to her
country in saving their lives.</p>

<p>"The military prosecutor said the argument might be
good for English soldiers, but that it did not apply to
Belgian young men, who would have been perfectly free
to remain in the country without danger to their lives.
The German military court found her guilty and sentenced
her to death by shooting."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>The execution took place at 2 o'clock in the morning
(October 12, 1915) immediately after the American and
Spanish diplomats left the house of the German Governor,
who refused their appeals.</p>

<p>The execution ground was a garden or yard in Brussels
surrounded by a wall. A German firing party of six
men and an officer was drawn up in the garden and
awaited its victim. She was led in by soldiers from a
house near-by, blindfolded with a black scarf. Up to
this minute the woman, though deadly white, had stepped
out bravely to meet her fate, but before the rifle party
her strength at last gave out and she tottered and fell
to the ground thirty yards or more from the spot where
she was to have been shot.</p>

<p>The officer in charge of the execution walked to her.
She lay prone on the ground, motionless. The officer
then drew a large service revolver from his belt, took
steady aim from his knee and shot the woman through
the head as she lay on the floor (this version is denied
by the German authorities). The firing party looked on.
The officer quietly returned his revolver to its case and
ordered the soldiers to carry the body to the house, where
charge was taken of it by a Belgian woman, acting under
the instructions of the Spanish Minister, who had undertaken
the responsibility for the body pending arrangements
for the burial.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>M. De Leval, a Belgian counsellor, makes this statement
of Edith Cavell's last message:</p>

<p>"This morning Mr. Gahan, an English clergyman, told
me that he had seen Miss Cavell in her cell yesterday
night at 10 o'clock and that he had given her the Holy
Communion and had found her admirably strong and
calm. I asked Mr. Gahan whether she had made any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
remarks about anything concerning the legal side of her
case, and whether the confession she made before trial
and in court was in his opinion perfectly free and sincere.
Mr. Gahan said she told him she was perfectly well and
knew what she had done; that, according to the law, of
course she was guilty, and admitted her guilt, but that she
was happy to die for her country."<a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF HUGH GIBSON, AMERICAN
DIPLOMAT</p>

<p>When we got to the Political Department we found
that Baron von der Lancken and all the members of his
staff had gone out to spend the evening at one of the
disreputable little theatres that have sprung up here for
the entertainment of the Germans. At first we were
unable to find where he had gone, as the orderly on duty
evidently had orders not to tell, but by dint of some
blustering and impressing on him the fact that Lancken
would have cause to regret not having seen us, he agreed
to have him notified. We put the orderly into the motor
and sent him off. The Marquis de Villalobar De Leval
and I settled down to wait, and we waited long, for
Lancken, evidently knowing the purpose of our visit, declined
to budge until the end of an act that seemed to
appeal to him.</p>

<p>He came in about 10:30, followed shortly by Count
Harrach and Baron von Falkenhausen, members of his
staff. I briefly explained to him the situation as we understood
it, and presented the note from the minister
transmitting the appeal for clemency. Lancken read the
note aloud in our presence, showing no feeling aside from
cynical annoyance at something&mdash;probably our having
discovered the intentions of the German authorities.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>
<p>When he had finished reading the note Lancken said
that he knew nothing of the case, but was sure in any
event that no sentence would be executed so soon as we
had said. He manifested some surprise, not to say annoyance,
that we should give credence to any report in regard
to the case which did not come from his department, that
being the only official channel. Leval and I insisted,
however, that we had reason to believe our reports were
correct and urged him to make inquiries. He then tried
to find out the exact source of our information, and
became insistent. I did not propose, however, to enlighten
him on this point, and said that I did not feel at
liberty to divulge our source of information.</p>

<p>Lancken then became persuasive&mdash;said that it was
most improbable that any sentence had been pronounced;
that even if it had, it could not be put into effect within
so short a time, and that in any event all government
offices were closed and that it was impossible for him to
take any action before morning. He suggested that we
all go home "reasonably," sleep quietly, and come back
in the morning to talk about the case. It was very clear
that if the facts were as we believed them to be the next
morning would be too late, and we pressed for immediate
inquiry. I had to be rather insistent on this point, and
De Leval, in his anxiety, became so emphatic that I
feared he might bring down the wrath of the Germans
on his own head, and tried to quiet him. There was
something splendid about the way De Leval, a Belgian,
with nothing to gain and everything to lose, stood up for
what he believed to be right and chivalrous, regardless of
consequences to himself.</p>

<p>Finally, Lancken agreed to inquire as to the facts, telephoned
from his office to the presiding judge of the court-martial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
and returned in a short time to say that sentence
had indeed been passed and that Miss Cavell was to be
shot during the night.</p>

<p>We then presented with all the earnestness at our command
the plea for clemency. We pointed out to Lancken
that Miss Cavell's offences were a matter of the past;
that she had been in prison for some weeks, thus effectually
ending her power for harm; that there was nothing
to be gained by shooting her, and, on the contrary, this
would do Germany much more harm than good and England
much more good than harm. We pointed out to
him that the whole case was a very bad one from Germany's
point of view; that the sentence of death had
heretofore been imposed only for cases of espionage, and
that Miss Cavell was not even accused by the German
authorities of anything so serious. At the time there was
no intimation that Miss Cavell was guilty of espionage.
It was only when public opinion had been aroused by her
execution that the German government began to refer
to her as "the spy Cavell." According to the German
statement of the case, there is no possible ground for
calling her a spy. We reminded him that Miss Cavell, as
directress of a large nursing home, had, since the beginning
of the war, cared for large numbers of German
soldiers in a way that should make her life sacred to
them. I further called his attention to the manifest failure
of the Political Department to comply with its repeated
promises to keep us informed as to the progress of
the trial and the passing of the sentence. The deliberate
policy of subterfuge and prevarication by which
they had sought to deceive us as to the progress of the
case was so raw as to require little comment. We all
pointed out to Lancken the horror of shooting a woman,
no matter what her offence, and endeavored to impress
upon him the frightful effect that such an execution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
would have throughout the civilized world. With a sneer
he replied that, on the contrary, he was confident that the
effect would be excellent.</p>

<p>When everything else had failed we asked Lancken to
look at the case from the point of view solely of German
interests, assuring him that the execution of Miss Cavell
would do Germany infinite harm. We reminded him of
the burning of Louvain and the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>,
and told him that this murder would rank with those
two affairs and would stir all civilized countries with
horror and disgust. Count Harrach broke in at this with
the rather irrelevant remark that he would rather see
Miss Cavell shot than have harm come to the humblest
German soldier, and his only regret was that they had not
"three or four old English women to shoot."</p>

<p>The Spanish Minister and I tried to prevail upon
Lancken to call Great Headquarters, at Charleville, on
the telephone and have the case laid before the Emperor
for his decision. Lancken stiffened perceptibly at this
suggestion and refused, frankly&mdash;saying that he could not
do anything of the sort. Turning to Villalobar, he said,
"I can't do that sort of thing. I am not a friend of my
sovereign as you are of yours," to which a rejoinder was
made that in order to be a good friend one must be loyal
and ready to incur displeasure in case of need. However,
our arguments along this line came to the point of saying
that the military governor of Brussels was the supreme
authority (Gerichtsherr) in matters of this sort,
and that even the Governor General had no power to
intervene. After further argument he agreed to get General
von Sauberschweig, the military governor, out of bed
to learn whether he had already ratified the sentence and
whether there was any chance for clemency.</p>

<p>Lancken was gone about half an hour, during which
time the three of us labored with Harrach and Falkenhausen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
without, I am sorry to say, the slightest success.
When Lancken returned he reported that the military
governor had acted in this case only after mature deliberation;
that the circumstances of Miss Cavell's offence
were of such a character that he considered infliction of
the death penalty imperative. Lancken further explained
that under the provisions of German military law the
Gerichtsherr had discretionary power to accept or to
refuse to accept an appeal for clemency; that in this case
the Governor regretted that he must decline to accept the
appeal for clemency or any representations in regard to
the matter.</p>

<p>We then brought up again the question of having the
Emperor called on the telephone, but Lancken replied
very definitely that the matter had gone too far; that the
sentence had been ratified by the military governor, and
that when matters had gone that far "even the Emperor
himself could not intervene." (Although accepted at the
time as true, this statement was later found to be entirely
false and is understood to have displeased the Emperor.
The Emperor could have stopped the execution at any
moment.)</p>

<p>Despite Lancken's very positive statements as to the
futility of our errand, we continued to appeal to every
sentiment to secure delay and time for reconsideration
of the case. The Spanish Minister led Lancken aside and
said some things to him that he would have hesitated to
say in the presence of Harrach, Falkenhausen and De
Leval, a Belgian subject. Lancken squirmed and blustered
by turns, but stuck to his refusal. In the meantime,
I went after Harrach and Falkenhausen again.
This time, throwing modesty to the winds, I reminded
them of some of the things we had done for German interests
at the outbreak of the war; how we had repatriated
thousands of German subjects and cared for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
interests; how during the siege of Antwerp I had repeatedly
crossed the lines during actual fighting at the
request of Field Marshal von der Goltz to look after
German interests; how all this service had been rendered
gladly and without thought of reward; that since the beginning
of the war we had never asked a favor of the
German authorities, and it seemed incredible that they
should now decline to grant us even a day's delay to discuss
the case of a poor woman who was, by her imprisonment,
prevented from doing further harm, and whose
execution in the middle of the night at the conclusion
of a course of trickery and deception was nothing short
of an affront to civilization. Even when I was ready to
abandon all hope, De Leval was unable to believe that
the German authorities would persist in their decision,
and appealed most touchingly and feelingly to the sense
of pity for which we looked in vain.</p>

<p>Our efforts were perfectly useless, however, as the
three men with whom we had to deal were so completely
callous and indifferent that they were in no way moved
by anything that we could say.</p>

<p>We did not stop until after midnight, when it was only
too clear that there was no hope.</p>

<p>It was a bitter business leaving the place feeling that
we had failed and that the little woman was to be led
out before a firing squad within a few hours. But it was
worse to go back to the legation to the little group of
English women who were waiting in my office to learn the
result of our visit. They had been there for nearly four
hours while Mrs. Whitlock and Miss Larner sat with
them and tried to sustain them through the hours of waiting.
There were Mrs. Gahan, wife of the English chaplain;
Miss B. and several nurses from Miss Cavell's
school. One was a little wisp of a thing who had been
mothered by Miss Cavell, and was nearly beside herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
with grief. There was no way of breaking the news to
them gently, for they could read the answer in our faces
when we came in. All we could do was to give them
each a stiff drink of sherry and send them home. De
Leval was white as death, and I took him back to his
house. I had a splitting headache myself and could not
face the idea of going to bed. I went home and read
for awhile, but that was no good, so I went out and
walked the streets, much to the annoyance of German
patrols. I rang the bells of several houses in a desperate
desire to talk to somebody, but could not find a soul&mdash;only
sleepy and disgruntled servants. It was a night I
should not like to go through again, but it wore through
somehow, and I braced up with a cold bath and went to
the legation for the day's work.</p>

<p>The day brought forth another loathsome fact in connection
with the case. It seems the sentence on Miss
Cavell was not pronounced in open court. Her executioners,
apparently in the hope of concealing their intentions
from us, went into her cell, and there, behind locked
door, pronounced sentence upon her. It's all of a piece
with the other things they have done.</p>

<p>On October 11 Mr. Gahan got a pass and was admitted
to see Miss Cavell shortly before she was taken out and
shot. He said she was calm and prepared, and faced the
ordeal without a tremor. She was a tiny thing that looked
as though she could be blown away with a breath, but
she had a great spirit. She told Mr. Gahan that soldiers
had come to her and asked her to be helped to the frontier;
that, knowing the risks they ran and the risks she
took, she had helped them. She said she had nothing to
regret, no complaint to make, and that if she had it all
to do over again she would change nothing.</p>

<p>They partook together of the Holy Communion, and
she who had so little need of preparation was prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
for death. She was free from resentment and said: "I
realize that patriotism is not enough. I must have no
hatred or bitterness toward any one."</p>

<p>She was taken out and shot before daybreak.</p>

<p>She was denied the support of her own clergyman at
the end, but a German military chaplain stayed with her
and gave her burial within the precincts of the prison.
He did not conceal his admiration, and said: "She was
courageous to the end. She professed her Christian faith
and said that she was glad to die for her country. She
died like a heroine."</p>

<h2>A BAYONET CHARGE IN PICARDY</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Told by a British Army Captain</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>A racy bit of battle description, hot from the guns, as spoken
by a wounded Captain who led one of the first rushes against
the German trenches in the great British drive in 1916. Recorded
in <i>Current History</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;HOW OUR ENGLISH COUSIN TELLS ABOUT
THE BATTLE</p>

<p>Eh? Oh, just an ordinary front-line trench, you
know; rather chipped about, of course, by the Boche
heavies, you know; but&mdash;oh, hang it, you know what the
ordinary fire trench looks like; along the north side of
the Mametz Wood we were. What? Oh, yes, we were
packed pretty close, of course, while we were waiting;
only got there a little before midnight. My chaps were
all in splendid heart, and keen as mustard to get the
word "Go!" I was lucky; met my friend &mdash;&mdash;, almost
directly we got in.</p>

<p>The weather was jolly then; but there'd been a lot of
rain, and the trench was in a beastly state. You know
what it's like, after a lot of strafing, when you get heavy
rains on the churned-up ground. It was like porridge
with syrup over it; and we were all absolutely plastered&mdash;hair
and mustaches and everything&mdash;before we'd been
half an hour in the place. The Boche was crumping us
pretty heavy all the time, but it didn't really matter, because,
for some reason, he didn't seem to have got our
range just right, and nearly all his big stuff was landing
in front or behind, and giving us very little but the mud
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>What did worry me a bit was his machine guns. His
snipers, too, seemed fairly on the spot, though how the
devil they could be, with our artillery as busy as it was,
I can't think. But I know several of my sentries were
laid out by rifle bullets. I particularly wanted to let the
others get a smoke when they could, seeing we'd be
there three or four hours; helps to keep 'em steady in
the waiting, you know; but we had to be mighty careful
about matches, the Boche being no more than a hundred
yards off.</p>

<p>Just before 3 I got my position, right in the middle
of my company. We were going over at 3:25, you know.
The trench was deep there, with a hell of a lot of mud
and water; but there was no set parapet left; just a
gradual slope of muck, as though cartloads of it had
been dropped from the sky by giants&mdash;spilt porridge. I
wanted to be first out, if I could&mdash;good effect on the
men, you know&mdash;but I couldn't trust myself in all that
muck, so I'd collared a rum-case from &mdash;&mdash;'s dugout,
and was nursing the blooming thing, so that when the
time came I could plant it in the mud and get a bit of a
spring from that. Glad I did, too.</p>

<p>I passed the word along at a quarter past to be ready
for my whistle; but it was all you could do to make a
fellow hear by shouting in his ear. Our heavies were
giving it lip then, I can tell you. I was in a devil of a
stew lest some of my chaps should get over too soon.
They kept wriggling up and forward in the mud. They
were frightfully keen to get moving. I gathered from
my Sergeant their one fear was that if we couldn't get
going our artillery would have left no strafing for us
to do. Little they knew their Boche, if they thought
that.</p>

<p>I thought I could just make out our artillery lift, about
a minute and a half before the twenty-five, but I wouldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
swear to it. On the stroke of the twenty-five I got a
good jump from my rum-box, and fell head first into a
little pool&mdash;whizz-bang hole, I suppose; something small.
It loosened two of my front teeth pretty much. I'd
my whistle in my teeth, you see. But I blew like blazes
directly I got my head up. Never made a sound.
Whistle full of mud. But it didn't matter a bit. They
all saw me take my dive, and a lot were in front of me
when I got going. But I overhauled 'em, and got in
front.</p>


<p>II&mdash;"DOWN 'EM, BOYS&mdash;STICK 'EM"</p>

<p>I believe we must have got nearly fifty yards without
a casualty. But it's hard to say. It wasn't light, you
know; just a glimmering kind of grayness. Not easy
to spot casualties. The row, of course, was deafening,
and we were running like lamplighters. You remember
our practice stunts at home? Short rushes, and taking
cover in folds of the ground. "Remember your file of
direction, Sir; dressin' by the right," and all that. Oh,
the boys remembered it right enough. But, good Lord,
it wasn't much like Salisbury Plain, you know. We were
going hell for leather. You think you're going strong,
and&mdash;Woosh! You've got your face deep in porridge.
Fallen in a shell hole. You trip over some blame thing,
and you turn a complete somersault, and you're on again,
wondering where your second wind is. Lord, you
haven't a notion whether you're hit or not.</p>

<p>I felt that smack on my left wrist, along with a dozen
other smacks of one sort and another, but I didn't know
it was a wound for an hour or more. All you thought
about was trying to keep your rifle muzzle up, and I
guess the fellows behind must've thought a bit about
not stickin' us with their bayonets more'n they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
help. I was shouting &mdash;&mdash;, the local name of the regiment,
you know. The boys like it. But my Sergeant,
who was close to me, was just yelling, "Down 'em,
boys!" and "Stick 'em! Stick 'em!" for all he was
worth.</p>

<p>My lot were bound for the second line, you see. My
No. 12 Platoon, with thirteen of "D," were to look after
cleaning up the Boche first line.</p>

<p>There was no real parapet left in that Boche front
line. Their trench was just a sort of gash, a ragged
crack in the porridge. Where I was, there was quite a
bit of their wire left; but, do you know, one didn't feel
it a bit. You can judge a bit from my rags what it was
like. We went at it like fellows in a race charge the
tape; and it didn't hurt us any more. Only thing that
worried us was the porridge and the holes. Your feet
sinking down make you feel you're crawling; making no
headway. I wish I could have seen a bit better. It was
all a muddy blur to me. But I made out a line of faces
in the Boche ditch; and I know I gave a devil of a yell
as we jumped for those faces. Lost my rifle there.</p>

<p>'Fraid I didn't stick my man, really, because my bayonet
struck solid earth. I just smashed my fellow. We
went down into the muck together, and another chap
trod on my neck for a moment. Makes you think quick,
I tell you. I pulled that chap down on top of my other
Boche, and just took one good look to make sure he was
a Boche; and then I gave him two rounds from my revolver,
with the barrel in his face. I think I killed the
under one too, but can't be sure.</p>


<p>III&mdash;"I GOT MY KNOCK-OUT"</p>

<p>Next thing I knew we were scrambling on to the
second line. It was in the wire of the second line that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
got my knockout; this shoulder and some splinters in
my head. Yes; bomb. I was out of business, then; but
as the light grew I could see my chaps having the time
of their lives inside that second line. One of 'em hauled
me in after a bit, and I got a drink of beer in a big
Boche dugout down two separate flights of steps. My
hat! That beer was good, though it was German. But,
look here, I'm in No. 5 train, that that chap's calling.
I must get ashore. Just want to tell you about that dugout
of &mdash;&mdash;'s in our own line, you know. It was 4
o'clock in the afternoon, and we'd got the Bazentin Wood
all right then, when my orderly, who never got a scratch,
was helping me back, making for our dressing station.
We crawled into what had been a trench, and while we
were taking a breather I sort of looked around, and
made out a bit here and a bend there. Begad, it was
the trench we started from.</p>

<p>Seems nothing, but you've no idea how odd it was
to me; like dropping into a bit of England after about a
century and a half in&mdash;in some special kind of hell, you
know. Seemed so devilish odd that any mortal thing
should be the same anywhere after that day. Not that
it was the same, really. My rum case was in splinters,
sticking up out of the porridge, and I found my map
case there, torn off my belt as we got over at 3:25.
"Won't be much left of that dugout," I thought, and I
got my orderly to help me along to see. Couldn't find
the blessed thing, anyhow. Went backward and forward
three or four times. Then I spotted the head of a
long trench stick that &mdash;&mdash; had carried, sticking out
through soft earth at the back of the trench. The orderly
worked that stick about a little, and the earth fell away.
It was just loose, dry stuff blown in off the front part
of the roof of the dugout, and blocking the little entrance.
Came away at a touch, almost, and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
the little hole you got in by. I worried through, somehow.
I was really curious to see. If you'll believe me,
the inside of that dugout&mdash;it looked like a drawing room
to me, after the outside, you know&mdash;it was just exactly
the same as when we'd left it the night before. There
was the fine stove we made the café-au-lait on, with a
half-empty box of matches balanced on the side of it, and
the last empty tin of the coffee stuff we'd used, with
the broken-handled spoon standing up in it, just as I'd
left it; and &mdash;&mdash;'s notebook lying open and face down on
an air pillow in his bunk&mdash;most extraordinarily homey.
There I was looking at his notebook, and his hold-all,
and poor &mdash;&mdash; dead. Yes, I'd seen his body. And the
rats, too; the rats were cavorting around on the felt of
the roof, happy as sandboys. They didn't know anything
about the Push, I suppose. By the way, we found
only dead rats in the Boche trenches. They say it was
our gas. I don't know; but there were thousands of
dead rats there, and millions of live fleas. Very live they
were. I must get. Cheero.</p>

<h2>THE SLAUGHTER AT DOUAUMONT</h2>

<div class="center"><i>Told by a French Soldier</i></div>


<p>Despite the horror of it, despite the ceaseless flow of
blood, one wants to see. One's soul wants to feed on
the sight of the brute Boches falling. I stopped on the
ground for hours, and when I closed my eyes I saw the
whole picture again. The guns are firing at 200 and 300
yards, and shrapnel is exploding with a crash, scything
them down. Our men hold their ground; our machine
guns keep to their work, and yet they advance.</p>

<p>Near me, as I lie in the mud, there is a giant wrapped
in one of our uniforms with a steel helmet on his head.
He seems to be dead, he is so absolutely still. At a
given moment the Boches are quite close to us. Despite
the noise of the guns one can hear their oaths and their
shouts as they strike. Then the giant next to me jumps
up, and with a voice like a stentor shouts "Hier da!
Hier da!" Mechanically some of us get up. (My wound,
which had been dressed, left me free and I had forgotten.)
I was unarmed and so I struck him with my steel
helmet and he dropped, with his head broken. An officer
who was passing sees the incident and takes off the man's
coat. Below is a German uniform. Where had the spy
come from and how had he got there?</p>

<p>But the Boches are returning again massed to the assault,
and they are being killed in bulk. It makes one
think that in declaring the war the Kaiser had sworn the
destruction of his race, and he would have shown good
taste in doing so. Their gunfire is slackening now, and
ours redoubles. The fort has gone, and if under its ruins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
there are left a few guns and gunners the bulk of the
guns are firing from outside. The machine guns are
coming up and getting in position, and our men are moving
on in numerous waves. I find a rifle belonging to a
comrade who has fallen and join the Chasseurs with the
fifty cartridges that I have left. What a fight it is, and
what troops! From time to time a man falls, rises,
shoots, runs, shoots again, keeps on firing, fights with his
bayonet, and then, worn out, falls, to be tramped on without
raising a cry. The storm of fire continues. Everything
is on fire&mdash;the wood near by, the village of Douaumont,
Verdun, the front of Bezonvaux, and the back of
Thiaumont. There is fire everywhere. The acrid smell
of carbonic acid and blood catches at our throats, but the
battle goes on.</p>

<p>They are brave, but one of our men is worth two of
theirs, especially in hand-to-hand fighting. They bend
and fall back, and the sound of the song they sing to
order, "Heil dir im Siegerkranz," only reaches us in hiccoughs.
Our reinforcements continue to arrive. We
are the masters. Our officers, with wonderful coolness,
control the ardor of the troops. The infantry action is
over. By its tirs de barrage the artillery is holding that
of the enemy, and we keep awaiting the fresh order for
action in silence.</p>
